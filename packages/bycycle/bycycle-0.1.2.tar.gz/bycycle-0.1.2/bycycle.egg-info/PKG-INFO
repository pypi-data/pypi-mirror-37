        =======================================================
        bycycle: cycle-by-cycle analysis of neural oscillations
        =======================================================
        
        bycycle is a python implementation of a cycle-by-cycle approach to analyzing
        neural oscillations (see Cole & Voytek, 2018, biorxiv). This approach
        quantifies features of neural oscillations in the time domain as opposed
        to the frequency domain. Rather than applying narrowband filters and other
        methods that utilize a sinusoidal basis, this characterization segments a
        recording into individual cycles and directly measures each of their properties
        including amplitude, period, and symmetry. This is most advantageous for
        analyzing the waveform shape properties of neural oscillations, but it may also
        provide advantages for studying traditional amplitude and frequency effects, as
        well. It also implements burst detection, which has been gaining traction
        recently (see e.g. Jones, 2016, COiN) so that we only analyze oscillatory
        properties when there is indeed an oscillation.
