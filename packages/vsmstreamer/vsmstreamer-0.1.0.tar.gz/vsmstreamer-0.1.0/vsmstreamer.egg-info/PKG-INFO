Description: # Cisco Video Surveillance Manager Streamer
        
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/vsmstreamer.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/vsmstreamer)
        
        *vsmstreamer* is a Python utility to stream Cisco Video Surveillance Manager
        streams on macOS.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        This utility requires the following software:
        
          - macOS (tested on 18.0.0, Mojave)
          - Python 2.7 or 3 (tested on 2.7.15, and 3.7)
          - [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (tested on 3.0.4 Vetinari)
          
        These are the Python modules that the utility depends on:
        
          - [configparser](https://pypi.org/project/configparser/)
          - [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests.git)
          - [PyCocoa](https://github.com/mrJean1/PyCocoa)
          - [python-vlc](https://pypi.org/project/python-vlc/)
          
        However, you need not install these packages by hand. Installing *vsmstreamer*
        through `pip` will automatically install these packages.

        ## Usage
        
        `vsmstreamer` is a command line utility. The following summarizes list of
        options available.
        
        ```
        $ vsmstreamer --help
        usage: vsmstreamer [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--profile PROFILE]
                           [--server SERVER] [--username USERNAME]
                           [--password PASSWORD] [--stream STREAM]
        
        Cisco Video Surveillance Manager Streamer
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          --config CONFIG, -c CONFIG
                                path to config file
          --profile PROFILE, -r PROFILE
                                profile name to use
          --server SERVER, -s SERVER
                                VSM server address
          --username USERNAME, -u USERNAME
                                VSM username
          --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                                VSM password
          --stream STREAM, -n STREAM
                                stream index to display
        ```
        
        In order to stream from a Cisco Video Surveillance Manager, you would need the
        following three parameters:
        
          - server address
          - username
          - password
          
        ### Credentials File
        
        The above mentioned parameters can be stored in a credentials file. The default
        path of the credentials file is `~/.vsm/credentials`. However, this path can be
        overridden using the `--config` command line option. This file can contain one
        are more sections. The section name is enclosed in a square bracket like this
        `[default]`. A desired section can be selected using the `--profile` command
        line option. A sample credentials file looks like this:
        
        ```
        [default]
        server = vsm.example.org
        username = jsmith
        password = $up3rsecret
        ```
        
        However, use of credentials file is optional. In the absence of the credentials
        file, the command line options `--server`, `--user`, and `--password` can be
        used to specify the required parameters.
        
        ### Streams
        
        *vsmstreamer* plays only one stream at a time. You can have many instances of
        this utility running at the same time if you want to want multiple streams. By
        default, this utility tunes to the first stream in the list of available
        streams. However, you can use `--stream` command line option to specify the
        stream index (0-indexed) to tune into.
