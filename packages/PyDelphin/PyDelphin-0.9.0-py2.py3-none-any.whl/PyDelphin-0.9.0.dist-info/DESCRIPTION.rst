PyDelphin provides a suite of libraries for modeling Minimal Recursion
Semantics (MRS; including DMRS), derivation trees, and [incr tsdb()]
profiles; introspection tools for Type Description Language (TDL),
which is used to define HPSG grammars; a Python wrapper for the ACE
parser; and some extra tools for syntax highlighting or LaTeX output.
Python developers who work with DELPH-IN data can rely on PyDelphin to
correctly deal with such data via convenient interfaces.
