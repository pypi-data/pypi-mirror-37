class TreacyCompressor:
    """ This class calculates the effects of a grating-based pulse compressor,
        as described in 
        E. B. Treacy, "Optical Pulse Compression With Diffraction Gratings",
        IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics QE5(9), p454 (1969):
        http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JQE.1969.1076303
        
        It implements eqn 5b from Treacy1969: ::
        
                                     -4 pi^2 c b 
        {1}  dt/dw =    -------------------------------------
                       w^3 d^2 (1- (2 pi c/ wd - sin gamma)^2)
                       

        where gamma is the diffraction angle, w is the angular frequency, d is
        the grating ruling period, and b is the slant distance between gratings, ::
        
        {1b} b = G sec(gamma - theta)
        
        where G is the grating separation and theta is the acute angle between
        indicent and diffracted rays (text before eq 4). The grating equation ::
        relates the angles (generalized eq 3):
        
        {2} sin(gamma - theta) + sin(gamma) = m lambda / d

        More conventionally, the grating equation is cast in terms of the
        incident and diffracted ray angles, ::
        
        {3} sin(alpha) + sin(beta) = m lambda / d.

        It makes sense to solve {3} using the grating specifications (eg for
        optimum incident angle a) and then derive Treacy's theta and gamma: ::
        
        {4} gamma = alpha                  theta = gamma - alpha
        
        This code only considers first order diffraction, as most gratings are
        designed for this (eg LightSmyth transmission gratings.)
