        ### What is this repository for? ###
        
        * This repository stores the source code for retrieving data (image
          or video) from network cameras.
        
        * This is part of Purdue's CAM2 (Continuous Analysis of Many CAMeras)
          project. The project's web site is https://www.cam2project.net/
        
        * Please read the terms of use

        In particular, "You agree not to use the Platform to determine the
        identity of any specific individuals contained in any video or video
        stream."

        ### Motivation ###
        
        Thousands of network cameras are connected to the Internet and provide
        real-time visual data (image or video).  Many network cameras require
        no password and anyone connected to the Internet can retrieve the
        data,i.e., the data is publicly available.  This program considers
        only publicly available camera data.
        
        Even though the data is publicly available to anyone interested
        seeing, there are several problems. First, there is no central
        repository where network cameras must register.  Thus, significant
        efforts must be taken to find various sources of data. Second,
        different brands of network cameras need different methods to retrieve
        the data.  The cameas may also provide different data formats: some
        provide individual JPEG images; some provide motion JPEG (MJPEG)
        video; some others provide H.264 video.
        
        Many organizations (such as departments of transportation) aggregate
        streams of multiple cameras and put these streams on web sites.
        However, these web sites have different formats and styles.  Some web
        sites use simple HTML; some use CSS; some use Javascript. Some web
        sites have fixed URLs for different cameras. Some web site have
        dynamically generated URLs reflecting the time (thus, the URLs are
        always changing).
        
        To solve these problems, researchers at Purdue University are
        developing the software to retrieve data from heterogeneous sources.
        
        This software requires a database that stores cameras' information
        (how to retrieve the data). The repository contains some examples of
        entries in a database (using MySQL).
        
        ### Documentation ###
        Full documentation can be found at https://purduecam2project.github.io/CAM2ImageArchiver/index.html
        
        ### Prerequisites ###
        
        * [Install MySQL](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/mysql.html) to maintain the camera database.
        
        * [Install OpenCV](https://github.com/jayrambhia/Install-OpenCV) to decode the downloaded images.
        ```
        sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv
        ```
        
        * Install MySQLdb to access the MySQL database from Python:
        ```
        sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
        ```
        
        ### Database Setup ###
        
        * Create an empty MySQL database using the following MySQL command:
        
        ```
        CREATE DATABASE cam2;
        ```
        
        * Build the database using the provided file and the following Linux command:
        ```
        mysql -u root -p cam2 < sample_database.sql
        ```
        
        * Modify the database credentials in the ```archiver.py``` module:
        ```
        DB_SERVER = 'localhost'
        DB_USER_NAME = 'root'
        DB_PASSWORD = ''
        DB_NAME = 'cameras'
        ```
        
        
        ### Files ###
        
        * ```CAM2ImageArchiver.py``` is the main Python module. It archives images from a single camera.
        * ```camera.py``` provides classes to communicate with different types of cameras: IP cameras, non-IP cameras, and stream cameras.
        * ```StreamParser.py``` is used by ```camera.py``` to parse JPEG and MJPEG streams.
        * ```error.py``` contains custom Python Exceptions.
        * ```CamerHandler.py``` splits the retrieval job into threads for parallel processing.
        
        ### Usage ###
        
        Example usage can be found in the documentation.
         
        This program downloads image snapshots from 2 sources
        
          (1) A given URL address
        
          (2) A camera ID in the MySQL database * MySQL database must be available on host computer.
