Description: # Introduction
        
        Alhambra, formerly tilesetdesigner, is a package for designing DNA tile systems,
        currently focused on DX tiles.  It uses stickydesign to create sticky end
        sequences, peppercompiler with spuriousSSM to create core sequences, and xgrow
        to simulate systems.  It uses an extensible system for tileset design, and a
        flexible YAML format for describing the tilesets.
        
        # Installation 
        
        Alhambra is designed to be installed as a Python package.  To install the
        current (semi-)stable version from the Python Package Index, you can simply use
        
            pip install alhambra
        		
        Alhambra is designed to work with Python 3, and may fail with Python 2.
        
        To install development versions, you can check out this github repository, and
        use `pip -e` or some other method for installing Python packages.  Multiple
        versions can be handled through `virtualenv`.
        
        All Alhambra requirements should be handled through setuptools dependencies, but
        note that xgrow and peppercompiler both rely on C code being compiled, which may
        fail.
        
        # Usage
        
        [Documentation is available online on readthedocs.io](https://alhambra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  In particular, see 
        [the tutorial](https://alhambra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).  It is also available in the docs/ folder.
        
        Most user-facing functions are on the TileSet class.
