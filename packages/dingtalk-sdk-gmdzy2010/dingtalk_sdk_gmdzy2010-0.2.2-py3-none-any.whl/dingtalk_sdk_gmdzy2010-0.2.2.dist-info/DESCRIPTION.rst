# dingtalk_sdk
the `non`-official python sdk for dingtalk

The offical sdk that dingtalk supplied are only Java, PHP and Node.js, what a shame for the absent of Python :), so the team "gmdzy2010" (only one member for now) take this job and now release the dev-plan:

### STAGE 1
>`Authority`

### STAGE 2
>The `user management` and `department management`

### STAGE 3
>The `message` part. There are some structure chaos in my view, work notice and group message originated from two distinct url: .../topapi/... and .../chat/..., fairyly strange.

Thanks for your patience :)
