# pyshortcuts


Pyshortcuts helps developers and Python users to create desktop shortcuts
that will run python scripts and applications.

Pyshortcuts is cross-platform, supporting Windows, MacOS, and Linux each in
the way most natural for the OS.  On Windows, a Shortcut or Link is
created.  On Linux a ".desktop" file is created.  On MacOS, a minimal
Application is created.  In all cases, these shortcuts are put either
directly on the Desktop or in a folder on the Desktop of the current user.
That means that there is not need for elevated permission or writing to
system-level files (registry, /Applications, /usr/bin).  The user has
complete control to rename, move, or delete the shortcut after it is
created.  Shortcuts can have a custom icon (`.ico` files on Windows or
Linux, or `.icns` files on MacOS) specified, defaulting to a Python icon
included with the pyshortcuts module.

Pyshortcuts is pure python, has a small footprint and is very easy to
install and use either from a python script.  That is to say, it can easily
be part of a installation (or post-installation process) process for larger
packages.

## installation

To install `pyshortcuts`, use

```
pip install pyshortcuts
```

or

```
conda install -c gsecars pyshortcuts
```

Pyshortcut requires the pywin32 package on Windows. This should be
installed automatically with either of the above install methods.

In order to use the pyshortcut GUI, the wxPython package is required.

## usage from Python

Shortcuts can be created from a Python script as with

```python

from pyshortcuts import make_shortcut

make_shortcut('/home/user/bin/myapp.py', name='MyApp',
                        icon='/home/user/icons/myicon.ico')
```

The arguments to `make_shortcut` are:

  * `script`   (str)  path to script to run.  This can include  command-line arguments
  * `name`   (str or None)  name to use for shortcut [defaults to script name]
  * `description`   (str or None)  longer description of script [defaults to `name`]
  * `icon`   (str or None) path to icon file [defaults to python icon]
  * `folder`   (str or None) folder on Desktop to put shortcut   [defaults to Desktop]
  * `terminal`   (True or False) whether to run in a Terminal [True]

##  `pyshortcut` command-line program

pyshortcuts installs a `pyshortcut` command-line program for creating shortcuts from a shell.

```
~> pyshortcut -n MyApp -i /home/user/icons/myicon.icns  /home/user/bin/myapp.py
```

To include command-line options to the script, put them in double quotes

```
~> pyshortcut -n MyApp -i /home/user/icons/myicon.icns "/home/user/bin/myapp.py  -t 10"
```

The `pyshortcut` command line program has the following optional arguments:

  * `--version`           show program's version number and exit
  * `-h`, `--help`        show help message and exit
  * `-n link_name`, `--name=link_name`  name for shortcut link
  * `-i icon_name`, `--icon=icon_name`  name of icon file
  * `-f subfolder`, `--folder=subfolder` subfolder on desktop to put icon
  * `-t`, `--terminal`   run script in a Terminal Window [True]
  * `-g`, `--gui`          run script as a GUI, with no Terminal Window [False]
  * `-w`, `--wxgui`     run GUI version of pyshortcut

Note that running in the Terminal is True by default.  For GUI applications
the extra Terminal or Command Window may be unwanted.


## `pyshortcut` GUI

In addition to the `pyshortcut` command-line program, there is a GUI
providing a simple form to help the user browse for script, icons, and set
options before creating a shortcut or generating a Python script to create
the shortcut.

This can be launched from the command line with

```
~> pyshortcut --wxgui
```

Of course you might want to create a desktop shortcut for this script, and
we have just the tool to do that.  This script (`gui_bootstrap.py` in
the `examples` folder) will create a shortcut for the pyshortcut GUI:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
import os
import sys
from pyshortcuts import make_shortcut, platform

bindir = 'bin'
if platform.startswith('win'):
    bindir = 'Scripts'

make_shortcut("%s --wxgui" % os.path.join(sys.prefix, bindir, 'pyshortcut'),
              name='PyShortcut', terminal=False)
```
