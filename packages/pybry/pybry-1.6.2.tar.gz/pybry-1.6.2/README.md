PyBry is a wrapper for the [lbry daemon](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry) and 
[lbrycrd daemon](https://github.com/lbryio/lbrycrd) API for Python 3.x

(Python 2 support will be added very soon)

## Installation

### With pip

Simply run the following

```bash
$ pip install pybry
```

And you're done!

### Manually Cloning the Repository

You can either clone this repository or get a tarball from PyPI's 
website for whatever version you want. Simply download it and


```bash
# Simply clone the repository somewhere
$ git clone https://github.com/osilkin98/pybry

# Or obtain a release from PyPI's site.
$ wget <extremely long link generated by PyPI> 

$ tar -xzf pybry-x.x.x.tar.gz PyBRY/

# Change directories into the newly created repository
$ cd PyBRY/

# Now you simply run the setup.py file:
$ python3 setup.py build_py install

```



## Usage

### Using the API

0. Make sure that `lbry-daemon` is up and running, as you will not be able to 
    do anything without it. 

1. First, import `LbrydApi` or `LbrycrdApi` from `pybry` into your project.


### API for LBRYD

#### Using the Generated Code

The API generates all the functions from the `lbryd` documentation, and translates
it into tangible, documented code. 

```python
[1] from pybry import LbrydApi

# Initialize the API
[2] lbry = LbrydApi()

# Just call the method as documented in the LBRYD API
[3] response = lbry.claim_list(name="bellflower")
```

Since all the code is properly documented, if you ask for its documentation in an IDE,
or if you go to read it for yourself, it'll appear like this:

```python
[4] response = lbry.account_balance()

    Return the balance of an account
    Params:
    account_id – If provided only the balance for this account will be given (Optional)
    address – If provided only the balance for this address will be given (Optional)
    include_unconfirmed – Include unconfirmed (Optional)
    Returns:
    (decimal) amount of lbry credits in wallet(decimal) amount of lbry credits in wallet

```
#### Calling the API Manually
Since all the code does is make requests to the lbry daemon, you can also 
use it as you would with cURL on the commandline. In fact, this is 
actually what the bodies of generated code do. 
```python
# You can also use the traditional method of making requests 
# if you prefer the cURL commandline syntax, works the same.
response = lbry.call("claim_list", {"name": "bellflower"})

```


### API For LbryCRD
```python
from pybry import LbrycrdApi

# Provide the username and password
lbrycrd = LbrycrdApi("username", "password")

# Just specify the method and the parameters
response = lbrycrd.call("wallet_unlock", {"wallet_username", "wallet_password"})

```
