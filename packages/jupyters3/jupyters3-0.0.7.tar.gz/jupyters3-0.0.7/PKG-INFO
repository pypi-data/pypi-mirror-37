Description: # Jupyter S3
        
        Jupyter Notebook Contents Manager for AWS S3.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install jupyters3
        ```
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
        To configure Jupyter Notebook to use JupterS3, you can add the following to your notebook config file.
        
        ```python
        from jupters3 import JupyterS3
        c = get_config()
        c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = JupyterS3
        ```
        
        You _must_ also set the following settings on `c.JupyterS3` in your config file. None of them are optional.
        
        | Setting | Description | Example |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | `aws_region` | The AWS region in which the bucket is located | `'eu-west-1'` |
        | `aws_host`  | The hostname of the AWS S3 API. Typically, this is of the form `<bucket-name>.s3.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com`. | `'my-example-bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com'` |
        | `aws_access_key_id` | The ID of the AWS access key used to sign the requests to the AWS S3 API. | _ommitted_ |
        | `aws_secret_access_key` | The secret part of the AWS access key used to sign the requests to the AWS S3 API. | _ommitted_ |
        | `prefix` | The prefix to all keys used to store notebooks and checkpoints. This can be the empty string `''`. If non-empty, typically this would end in a forward slash `/`. | `'some-prefix/`' |
        
        
        ## Differences from S3Contents
        
        - There are no extra dependencies over those already required for Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, there is not a virtual filesystem abstraction used internally.
        
        - Checkpoints are also saved to S3, under the key `<file_name>/.checkpoints/`.
        
        - Multiple checkpoints are saved.
        
        - Requests to S3 are host-style, using a custom domain for the bucket, rather that path-style.
        
        - AWS roles are not supported, although this may change.
