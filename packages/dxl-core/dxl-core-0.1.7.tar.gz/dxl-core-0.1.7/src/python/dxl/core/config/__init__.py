Useage:

1. load config to a dict object
2. following these codes:

```
dct = {
    'aaa':{
        'bbb':{
            'x': 1,
            'y': 2,
        }
        'z' : 3,
    }
}
c = create_config_tree()
v = create_view(c, 'aaa/bbb')
v['x']
>>> 1
v['y']
>>> 2
v['z']
>>> 3
```

Config module make it easy for config intens projects.

Config module consists of following classes:
ConfigsViewer:
    Configs viewer class.

ConfigsMaker:

"""
New design:
    This package should consisted of the following classes:

    1.  Viewer (R)
        A Viewer is a object with 
        Provide facility for querying config via:
            normal key/name: `'key'`
            path-like: `'aaa/bbb/ccc'` and `'aaa.bbb.ccc'` (configurable)
    
    2.  Loader (C)
        Construct config tree from files/scripts
    
    3.  Updator (U)
        Update config tree
    
    4.  CNode / CTree (Model)
        Data structure of storing configs in memory
        Support serilization to .json/.yaml

        To deal with multiple config tree combination (multiple default):
            CNodeAnonymous
    
    Also provide the following helper functions:
    default() -> default config tree

Design V3:
    1. Everything is saved in a real dict (no any special objects).
    2. All operations were done via CNode.
    3. Basic views were done via CView.
    4. Advanced view were done by concrete class of CSpec.

    class CNode:
        def __init__(self, data:dict):
            pass
        
        def __getitem__(self, key):
            pass
