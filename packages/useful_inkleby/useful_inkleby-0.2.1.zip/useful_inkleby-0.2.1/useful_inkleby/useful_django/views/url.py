IntegratedURLView - Sidestep django's url.py based setup and integrate
urls directly with view classes rather than keeping them seperate.

This will mix-in either with the functional inkleby view or the default
django class-based views. 

In views module you set up a series of classes that inherit from
IntegratedURLView and then connect up in project url like so:

url(r'^foo/', include_view('foo.views')),

Philosophy behind this is that the current urlconf system was designed for
functional views - class-based  views have to hide themselves as functions 
with an as_view function, which is ugly. By moving responsibility for 
generating these to the class view it avoids awkward manual repetition 
and keeps all settings associated with the view in one place.
Apps then don't need a separate url.py.
