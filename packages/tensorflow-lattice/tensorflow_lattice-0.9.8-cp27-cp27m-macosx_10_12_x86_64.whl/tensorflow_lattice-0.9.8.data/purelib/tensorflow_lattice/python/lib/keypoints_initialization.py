"""Piecewise linear calibration keypoints initialization functions.

Piecewise linear calibration requires initialization of its keypoints inputs
and outputs. If these initialization values are known one can use them directly.

But usually these initialization values are calculated in one of two ways:

1) As a preprocessing step one calculates the quantiles of some input features
(see function save_quantiles_for_keypoints below). Then during training
this quantile is sub-sampled to the number of keypoints, and these are the
initialization values used (see function load_keypoints_from_quantiles below).
Since the quantiles are independent of the number of keypoints, the quantiles
saved once can be used for training of models with different number of
keypoints, so the saved quantiles can be loaded multiple times during
hyperparameter optimization.

2) The user knows the input range and the number of keypoints. Use the function
uniform_keypoints_for_signal below to calculate evenly spread initialization
keypoints inputs based on that.

Notice that in both scenarios it is assumed that the user knows the output range
and the keypoints outputs are initialized linearly along the min and the max
of the output, so the calibration starts as a fully linear model.

Notice that the keypoints initialization values are saved, so they are no longer
needed in production (inference) time.

  These values can later be retrieved and used by keypoints_from_quantiles()

  Repeated values are discarded before the quantiles are calculated. That means
  that the quantiles of a very skewed distribution (for instance where 99%
  of the values are 0), will be different. But for the purpose of calibration
  this approach is more useful.

  Nothing is returned, the values are simply saved in the given location.

  This function can be called as a preprocessing step before actual training
  starts. Typically one will run this in a separate process locally, before
  starting training for instance.

  Args:
    input_fn: Similar to input_fn provided to Estimators. Typically one
      doesn't need to go over the full data to get good quantiles. Typically
      some 100 random examples per quantile is good enough for the purpose of
      calibration. If you don't have too much data, just use everything.
      If input_fn returns a target (used in training) it is ignored.
    save_dir: Where to save these quantiles. Since when optimizing
      hyper-parameters we train various models, we can share the quantiles
      information generated here. So this should be a directory that can be
      accessed by all training sessions. A subdirectory called "quantiles" will
      be created, and inside one file per feature is created: named after the
      feature name, and with the quantiles stored in JSON format.
    feature_columns: If set, quantiles are generated for these feature columns.
      The file name used to save the quantiles uses a hash of the names of the
      feature_columns, so it can support different quantiles sets for different
      parts of the model if needed. If not set quantiles will be generated for
      all features returned by input_fn.
    num_steps: number of steps to take over input_fn to gather enough data to
      create quantiles. Set to 0 or None to run until queue is exhausted,
      like if you used num_epochs in your input_fn.
    override: if False it won't regenerate quantiles for files that are already
      there. This works as long as the features definition/distribution hasn't
      change from one run to another.
    num_quantiles: This value should be larger than the maximum number of
      keypoints that will be considered for calibrating these features. If
      there are not enough quantiles for the keypoints, the system is robust and
      will simply interpolate the missing quantiles. Similarly if there are not
      enough examples to represent the quantiles, it will interpolate the
      quantiles from the examples given.
    dtype: Default dtype to use, in particular for categorical values.

  Returns: Nothing, results are saved to disk.

  Raises:
    errors.OpError: For I/O errors.

  FutureWork:
    * Use Munro-Paterson algorithm to calculate quantiles in a streaming
      fashion. See Squawd library.
    * Add support to weighted examples.
    * Handle cases where there are not enough different values in quantiles.
