Description: # create-python-package
        Initialize a new package using best practices as described by the [Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/).
        
        Perfect for beginners and experts alike!
        
        ```
        > create-python-package mypackage
        ```
        
        No more guesswork!
        
        The file structure you're left with looks like this
        ```
        mypackage/
        ├── LICENSE
        ├── README.md
        ├── activate-venv -> /private/tmp/mypackage/venv/bin/activate
        ├── mypackage
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   └── main.py
        └── setup.py
        ```
        
        ## Virtualenv ready to go!
        Inside the directory you can run
        ```
        source activate-venv
        ```
        to activate an isolated Python environment that was created specifically for that package. To deactivate it, type
        ```
        deactivate
        ```
        
        To learn more about virtual environments, see [Creating Virtual Environments](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments).
        
        ## Install
        My recommendation is to run the latest version of `create-python-package` with pipx rather than installing it and freezing the version on your system. This is because as new tools and practices are added to `create-python-package`, you will automatically be using them.
        
        Install [pipx](https://github.com/cs01/pipx).
        
        ```
        > pipx create-python-package mypackage  # runs latest version
        ```
        
        If you really want to install it you can.
        ```
        > pipx install create-python-package
        ```
        
        Requires Python 3.6+.
