/* 
  ASSEMBL DEFAULT THEME
  If you want to create a new theme, it is recommended that your theme SCSS file uses @import of this file, so if a default theme variable is not overriden in your theme (for example a variable which would have been added in Assembl code after the creation of your theme), the SCSS will still compile, and the variable will have the default value.

  Variables
  Ranked from light -> dark

  NEVER refer to these color variables elsewhere in the SCSS files
