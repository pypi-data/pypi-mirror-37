# This script pipes all "aileen" commands over to flask CLI tasks, so we can call them in a familiar way.
# For a different way forward, see http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/dev/cli/#custom-scripts, which I found not worth exploring at the time.
# Tricky to set up, and then it doesn't play so well with errors. Would still be nice to get running.
