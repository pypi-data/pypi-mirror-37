# learnbot_components

This project has been designed as a tool to learn different topics, like programing, logic, math, emotions, physic, robotic, ... 

The methodology used to teach this knowledges is the following:
The kids make programs, with a IDE (Learnblock) this programs and this programs control a smal robot (EBO).

## Learnblock

This program is the main.  It is here where the kids make his/her programs. This programs can be created with language similar to scratch, that is to say, using blocks.

## EBO 

EBO is a small robot, that run some components that offer interfaces to control it.
