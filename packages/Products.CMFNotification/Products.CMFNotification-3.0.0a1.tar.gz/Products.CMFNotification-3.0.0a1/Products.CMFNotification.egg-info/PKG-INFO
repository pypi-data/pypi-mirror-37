        CMFNotification
        ===============
        
        CMFNotification is a Plone product that allows users to be notified
        when various events occur in the portal:
        
        - when an item is created or copy-pasted;
        
        - when an item is modified;
        
        - when a workflow transition occurs.
        
        Other notifications might be implemented but, for now, only the three
        above can be safely used. (In other words, do not trust the
        configuration form, which includes for example fields for discussion
        notification, although it is **not** implemented.)
        
        CMFNotification is configured with rules:
        
        - rules to decide who should be notified;
        
        - rules to decide what mail template to use.
        
        Besides these rules, CMFNotification handles extra subscription to any
        portal item. This allows authenticated users to subscribe to an item
        and receive notification, if the notification policy does not already
        include him/her in the list of notified users. These extra
        subscription may be recursive: if so, an user which has subscribed to
        a folder is notified for any event which occurs on the folder and any
        of its items (including its subfolders, etc.).
        
        CMFNotification also contains a menu to allow admins to unsubscribe
        users from any content in the site. This menu accessible in "site setup"
        and gives a list of the users in alphabetical order, with the path to
        each object they are subscribed to.
        
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        This version of CMFNotification runs on Plone 3.3 and Plone 4. It
        should also run on Plone 3.0 to 3.3 (automated tests are not run on
        those versions). However, it does not run on Plone 1.x and 2.x.
        
        Despite the name, this product may not work in a pure CMF
        portal. Minor changes may be needed. I thought about having an
        implementation which works for pure CMF portals, hence the
        name. However, use-cases rules and I did not have any pure CMF
        use-case... This may or may not happen in the future.
        
        **Important note:** please note that the standard Secure MailHost
        (which is shipped with Plone) and its base product (MailHost) are not
        intended to send a lot of emails. It is highly suggested to install
        `MaildropHost`_ if you are about to do so.

        - The actual notification process, namely sending an email to interested
          users, has been split into a named utility. You can register your own
          notification methods in the same way, and CMFNotification will be able
          to use them. This allows for other distribution methods than just email.

        ------------------------------------------
        
        - worked around a nasty bug that caused the portal to be broken when
          CMFNotification was uninstalled and a subscription portlet was still
          configured somewhere;
        
        - cleaned uninstallation through a GenericSetup profile. [kurt]
        
        - updated tests for Plone 4. [dbaty]
        
        - fixed default notification templates to have them work in Plone 4

        ---------------------
        
        - Registered the permission in zcml and call setDefaultRoles in __init__.py. [jcbrand]
        
        
        2.2dev1 (25 February 2010)
        --------------------------
        
        - The svn repository for the new eggified package has changed:
          http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/Products.CMFNotification [jcbrand]
        
        - Made CMFNotification a setuptools/distribute Python egg package [jcbrand]
        
        - Remove the creation/registration of the PTSTranslationDomain utility. It has
          been deprecated in favour of zope.18n.translationdomain.TranslationDomain
          [jcbrand]
        
        
        2.1 (4 July 2008)
        -----------------
        
        - added notification on object removal
        
        - added safety belts for perverted usage;
        
        - added AJAX features in the subscription portlet: if the user has
          enabled Javascrpt, the page is not refreshed when (s)he presses the
          subscribe/unsubscribe button;
        
        - rewrote overly complicated ``_getPreviousVersion()`` method.
        
        
        2.0 (24 June 2008)
        ------------------
        
        - finally provided an implementation for the ``previous`` binding that
          will let integrators display changes in notification template when
          an item is modified;
        
        - added handler for item copy/paste, which now triggers "item
          creation" rules;
        
        - moved installation code to Generic Setup steps;
        
        - added an old Brazilian Portuguese translation contributed by Julio
          Monteiro;
        
        - added labels on users selection rules so that different e-mails can
          be sent on the same action;
        
        - added ``previous_state`` binding on workflow notification;
        
        - fixed an i18n bug in the portal status messages generated by the
          subscribe/unsubscribe buttons in the portlet;
        
        - added import/export mechanism for Generic Setup;
        
        - changed the method that retrieves the mail template: by using
          ``restrictedTraverse()`` instead of ``getattr()``, we now allow the
          template to be a browser view;
        
        - replaced ``title`` by ``Title`` in default mail templates (thanks to
          Martin Stadler for his bug report);
        
        - fixed link (added ``/view``) in default mail templates;
        
        - added safety belt when we cannot fetch an user's e-mail address
          (thanks to Laurence Pawling for his bug report);
        
        - header encoding function is now more robust and handles more fields
          (including ``From``, which it did not handle);
        
        - header encoding function now encodes only headers. It used to be a
          bit greedy and could possibly encode the message itself, leading to
          funny text, though not really readable;
        
        - fixed uninstallation issues (CMFNotification used to leave remnants
          of itself);
        
        - fixed a bug that caused bindings not to be included in mail
          templates options;
        
        - added ``current_state`` binding for all rules and mail templates;
        
        - "Mail subscription" portlet is now automatically added when the
          product is installed;
        
        - minor changes in tests and documentation.
        
        
        2.0 release candidate 1 (unknown release date)
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        - CMFNotification now **requires** Plone 3. It is **not** compatible
          with prior versions of Plone anymore;
        
        - new, simplified, text-only notification mail templates. If you have
          a CMFNotification 1.x notification templates, they may still work,
          though.
        
        
        1.1 (14 September 2007)
        -----------------------
        
        - added how-to's, arranged documentation and converted it to reST.
        
        - fixed a bug which caused CMFNotification to ask the user to download
          a file when (s)he subscribes or unsubscribes to it. Thanks to
          Christophe Sauthier for the patch.
        
        - added translation in German, thanks to Gunter Vasold.
        
        
        1.0 (28 August 2007)
        --------------------
        
        - added debug properties to the configuration.
        
        - added Maildrop Host in list of recognized mailhost types.
        
        - removed useless ``sendTemplateTo()`` method from notification tool.
        
        - stripped rule components so that we can now write rules which are
          readable, like ``* :: *`` instead of the ugly ``*::*``.
        
        
        0.9.0 (4 June 2006)
        -------------------
        
        First public release.
