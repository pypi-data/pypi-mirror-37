pyotgw - A python library to interface with the OpenTherm Gateway

See http://otgw.tclcode.com for the hardware.

This library is written primarily for use with Home Assistant (https://www.home-assistant.io) but can be used for other purposes as well.
So far there's no Home Assistant platform which uses this library, but once it is in a more mature stage I will put some effort in that part as well.
The code is very much incomplete and definitely not ready for general use, but feel free to test and contribute where you see fit.
