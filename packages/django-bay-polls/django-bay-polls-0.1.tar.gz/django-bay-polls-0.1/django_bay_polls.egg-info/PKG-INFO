        Polls is a simple Django app to conduct Web-based polls. For each
        question, visitors can choose between a fixed number of answers to
        vote on.
        
        Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.
        
        Quick start
        
        -----------
        
        1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
          INSTALLED_APPS = [
              ...
              'polls',
        
          ]
        
        2. Include the polls URLconf in your project's urls.py like this::
        
             path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
         
           remember to put the comma(,) at the end
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` to create the polls models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/ to participate in the poll.
