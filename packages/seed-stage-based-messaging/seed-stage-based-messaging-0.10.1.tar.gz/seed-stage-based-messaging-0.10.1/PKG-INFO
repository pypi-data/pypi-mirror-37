Description: ==========================
        Seed Stage-Based Messaging
        ==========================
        
        The Seed Stage-Based Messaging Store is one of the microservices in the Seed
        Stack.
        
        The Stage-Based Messaging Store has the following key responsibilities:
        
        - Store the stage-based content (both audio and text).
        - Store the stage-based content schedules.
        - Store the stage-based content subscriptions for each user.
        
        
        Changelog
        ---------
        
        0.10.0
        ______
         - Changed to having a schedule per schedule, instead of a schedule per 
           subscription. Any new or updated schedules will automatically be created or
           updated in the scheduler, but for existing schedules, there's a
           `sync_schedules` management command. Existing schedules linking directly
           to subscriptions will be cancelled whenever they get called.
         - Added a new celery queue, 'highmemory', which has the task to queue up all
           the subscription sends for each schedule when the endpoint is called
