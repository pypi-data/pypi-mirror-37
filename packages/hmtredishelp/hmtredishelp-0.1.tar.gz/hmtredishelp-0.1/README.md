# Redis Wrappers

We provide a bunch of wrappers around ephemeral stores to make them more useful

- Abstract basic master/slave* work for the master and the slave.
- Provide simple python abstractions around type *written by tinkerer*
- redis support









*I hate the term master/slave but this is what redis and redis sentry used when we wrote this
