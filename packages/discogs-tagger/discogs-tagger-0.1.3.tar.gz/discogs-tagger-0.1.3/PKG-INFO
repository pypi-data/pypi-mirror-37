Description: # discogs-tagger
        Simple script that tags your music files with album metadata from Discogs database.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Simply install it using pip:
        
        ```
        # pip install discogs-tagger
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        usage: discogs-tagger.py [-h] [-u URL] [-i] file [file ...]
        
        Simple script that tags your music files with album metadata from Discogs
        database.
        
        positional arguments:
          file               file(s) you want to tag
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help         show this help message and exit
          -u URL, --url URL  Discogs release URL. Important: it must not be master
                             release!
          -i, --interactive  Option that allows user to manually choose artist and
                             album release.
        ```
        
        To tag your files, with discogs-tagger you can choose one method of two. The first one is automatic search. You give the script `-u <url>` option and it'll automatically download all the info on the album. Important - it mustn't be master release! Only albums without subreleases. Example:
        
        ```
        $ discogs-tagger -u https://www.discogs.com/Radiohead-OK-Computer/release/4950798 ~/Music/OkComputerDir/*.flac
        ```
        
        The other way is interactive search. You must enter artists name and then the script will show you available artists to choose from, then you choose a master release and subrelease. Command:
        
        ```
        $ discogs-tagger -i ~/Music/SomeMusicDir/*.flac
        ```
        
        What's also important, you should always choose files, otherwise the script won't do anything.
        
        ### Settings file
        
        When you first run discogs-tagger, it will create new file at `~/discogs-tagger.settings`. Example settings file looks like this:
        
        ```
        format=${d-}${n} - ${t}
        artist-query-size=5
        tag-lyrics=true
        genre-base=style
        ```
        
        - format - it's the format of file names that are being tagged
        - artist-query-size - decides how many artists will show up in interactive mode
        - tag-lyrics - boolean, decides if the lyrics will be embedded in the files (it may lenghten the process of tagging)
        - genre-base - decides what Discogs tag it uses to describe genre: `style` or `genre`
        
        #### File name formatting
        
        These are tags used in file name formatting (`format` key in settings file):
        - `${d}` - disc number
        - `${dt}` - total disc number
        - `${n}` - track number
        - `${nt}` - total track number
        - `${t}` - track title
        - `${a}` - artist
        - `${b}` - album artist
        
        You can as well put special characters (but only valid for your filesystem). This
        example
        
        ```
        format=${d-}${n} - ${_t_}
        ```
        
        may result in something like this: `01-05 - _Some title_`
