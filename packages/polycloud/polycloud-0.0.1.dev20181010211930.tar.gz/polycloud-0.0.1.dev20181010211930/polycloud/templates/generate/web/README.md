## Features

<dl>
  <dt>Quick scaffolding</dt>
  <dd>Create components, containers, routes, selectors and sagas - and their tests - right from the CLI!</dd>

  <dt>Instant feedback</dt>
  <dd>Enjoy the best DX (Developer eXperience) and code your app at the speed of thought! Your saved changes to the CSS and JS are reflected instantaneously without refreshing the page. Preserve application state even when you update something in the underlying code!</dd>

  <dt>Predictable state management</dt>
  <dd>Unidirectional data flow allows for change logging and time travel debugging.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>Use template strings, object destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more.</dd>

  <dt>Next generation CSS</dt>
  <dd>Write composable CSS that's co-located with your components for complete modularity. Unique generated class names keep the specificity low while eliminating style clashes. Ship only the styles that are on the page for the best performance.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard routing</dt>
  <dd>It's natural to want to add pages (e.g. `/about`) to your application, and routing makes this possible.</dd>

  <dt>Industry-standard i18n internationalization support</dt>
  <dd>Scalable apps need to support multiple languages, easily add and support multiple languages with `react-intl`.</dd>

  <dt>Offline-first</dt>
  <dd>The next frontier in performant web apps: availability without a network connection from the instant your users load the app.</dd>

  <dt>Static code analysis</dt>
  <dd>Focus on writing new features without worrying about formatting or code quality. With the right editor setup, your code will automatically be formatted and linted as you work.</dd>

  <dt>SEO</dt>
  <dd>We support SEO (document head tags management) for search engines that support indexing of JavaScript content. (eg. Google)</dd>
</dl>

But wait... there's more!

- _The best test setup:_ Automatically guarantee code quality and non-breaking
  changes. (Seen a react app with 100% test coverage before?)
- _Native web app:_ Your app's new home? The home screen of your users' phones.
- _The fastest fonts:_ Say goodbye to vacant text.
- _Stay fast_: Profile your app's performance from the comfort of your command
  line!
- _Catch problems:_ AppVeyor and TravisCI setups included by default, so your
  tests get run automatically on Windows and Unix.

Thereâ€™s also a <a href="https://vimeo.com/168648012">fantastic video</a> on how to structure your React.js apps with scalability in mind. It provides rationale for the majority of boilerplate's design decisions.

## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node v8 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo using `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git`
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd react-boilerplate`.<br />
4.  Run `npm run setup` in order to install dependencies and clean the git repo.<br />
    _We auto-detect `yarn` for installing packages by default, if you wish to force `npm` usage do: `USE_YARN=false npm run setup`_<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._
5.  Run `npm run clean` to delete the example app.

Now you're ready to rumble!

> Please note that this boilerplate is **production-ready and not meant for beginners**! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.

# Folder Structure

`/.storybook`: config for the storybook for component development
`/conf`: config for nginx for container deployment
`/public`: static assets (`index.html`, `favicon.ico`)
`/src`: javascript code (`components`, `containers` (views/pages), `services` (need?), `redux` (ducks), `index.js` )

## How to do data access / how to create your compoents? 

Component should not directly access data, either use *Redux* or *Services*. The component uses an actionCreator to create an action and a reducer to fetch the data and update the global state. Where to put the business logik? (pure reducers, action do not specify how but only what ...). See below.

The data is then injected to the components thorugh stateful containers. Components are simple and do not fetch data but represent simple inject state from a higher level component.

In Angular data access is abstracted through *services: more info [here](https://angular.io/tutorial/toh-pt4). I prefer using *Redux*.

Components do not contain business logic. Business Logik is always inside of handlerfunctions in a containers that then uses redux to mange the state through actions.  https://medium.com/@jeffbski/where-do-i-put-my-business-logic-in-a-react-redux-application-9253ef91ce1 / https://github.com/jeffbski/redux-logic#compared-to-redux-saga


## Development & Testing

For the UI only use Integration Testing & and do storybook driven development (for components). (link to my blog): https://www.cypress.io/
- start by designing the component and the data it requires (-> redux)
- then build the components to display and interact with the data

# Create react app documenation on how to do things

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# How to adapt this as a template:

In the Istio template: 
update name: `developer-portal-ui` to `your-name`
updter port: `80` to `your-port`

update the image name `developer-portal-ui` in the `build-and-deploy.sh` (this also udates the template name that is used in the script)

update the endpoint that are called by the frontend in `/src/config.js` for prod from `http://identities:9090` to your backend `xxx`.
