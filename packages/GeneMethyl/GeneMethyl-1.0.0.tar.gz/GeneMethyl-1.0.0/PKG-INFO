Summary: By this package, you can simply calculate the epigenetic result caused by a specific disease and reveal the relationship between the epigenetic effect and specific genes' expressions. For numerous samples of a specific disease, you can get a correlation value between gene expression levels and summations calculated from DNA methylation beta-values. Additionally you can simply know beta-value distribution by density plot.

        A. Goal
        
        	DNA methylation, adding methyl group to 5' carbon of a cytosine pyrimidine ring, is considered as a important biomarker for some diseases.
        	And CpG sites, regions of a single DNA strand where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide, are known as easily methylated in human body.
        	Methylation of CpG sites can affect specific genes' expression levels and in some diseases like cancer, CpG sites' hypermethylation silence tumor suppressor genes' activities and hypomethylation promote retrotransposons' activities like LINE-1 to make chromosome instability.
        	So, numerous clinical researches about methylation of CpG sites were already completed and still be underway.
        	To make easily analyze relationship between DNA methylation status and target genes' activities, I made the packaged named GeneMethyl.
        	I hope this package will contribute to many researches. And I plan to add more functions to solve more complicated problems.
        
        
        
        	
        B. Input data format
        
        	Required Files : DNA methylation data, RNAseq data(raw counts or normalized by RSEM) of samples about a target disease.
        
        	1. File name : [TargetDiseaseName].DNA_methylation_450K.tsv (Separated by tab)
        
        		Column : Each sample
        		Row : Each CpG site
        
        		Missing values are denoted as nothing. (Just separted by tab)
        		We recognize sample length up to 12. (excluding '-', or '_')
        
        	Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450K Beadchip made us easily get DNA methylation data for selected CpG sites about 480,000.
        	So, this package use beta-value data table generated from HumanMethylation450K.
        	And the format of a DNA methylation dataset is the same with a TCGA's pan-cancer atlas methylation dataset.
        
        		
        
        	2. File name : [TargetDiseaseName].PANCANCER.RNAseq.tsv (Separated by tab)
        
        		Column : Each sample
        		Row : Each gene
        
        		Missing values are denoted as nothing. (Just separted by tab)
        		We recognize sample length up to 12. (excluding '-', or '_')
        
        	Your target gene expression levels are automatically calculated from RNAseq raw counts data or normalized data by RSEM package.
        	And the format of a RNAseq dataset is the same with a TCGA's pan-cancer atlas RNAseq dataset.
        
        
        
        
        
        C. Package functions
        
        	1. BetavalueDistribution
        
        		(1) BetavalueDistribution.Draw("TargetDiseaseName", Cutoff, WhetherHistogram) : Drawing beta-value distribution by density plot based on histogram.
        
        			Input parameters : 
        
        				"TargetDiseaseName" : Target disease name
        				Cutoff : Cutoff must be in [0, 1] and sections are divided by this cutoff.
        					ex) Cutoff : 0.1 	-> 	Your Sections : 0~0.1, 0.1~0.2, 0.2~0.3, 0.3~0.4, 0.4~0.5, 0.5~0.6, 0.6~0.7, 0.7~0.8, 0.8~0.9, 0.9~1.0
        				WhetherHistogram : True or False. If you choose True, histogram of beta-values divided by cutoff is also shown.
        
        
        			Description : 
        
        				DNA methylation data is too large to easily handle, so receiving whole DNA methylation data and drawing density plot at once is not effective from the perspective of memory.
        				So, I received DNA methylation data line by line and approximated DNA methylation beta-values into several sections divided by specific cutoff. (You can choose cutoff)
        				Then by using histogram, I made density plot of beta-values' distribution.

        			Background : 
        
        				Before explaining TopNpercentageCutoff, we have to determine what percentage means in this method.
        
        				In some diseases like cancer, beta-value distribution of each CpG site is look like roughly 2-peaked graph.
        				So, I roughly classified beta-value distribution of each CpG site as 2 categories, left-skewed and right-skewed.
        				To determine skewedness of CpG sites, we compare median of each CpG site with mean or 0.5( = an exact half of [0, 1]).
        					If you want to use 'mean method', you need to make WhetherMeanMethod True.
        					If you want to use '0.5 method', you need to make WhetherMeanMethod False.
        
        				After determining skewedness, we can classify types as "Positive", "Negative", "Both".
        					If type is "Positive" and CpG site's beta-value distribution is right-skewed, top N% of sample beta-value is converted into 1. Or, into 0.
        					If type is "Positive" and CpG site's beta-value distribution is left-skewed, bottom N% of sample beta-value is converted into 1. Or into 0.
        					Thus, "Positive" type means we count the number of beta-values following the tendency of each CpG site's distribution for each sample.
        
        					If type is "Negative" and CpG site's beta-value distribution is right-skewed, bottom N% of sample beta-value is converted into 1. Or, into 0.
        					If type is "Negative" and CpG site's beta-value distribution is left-skewed, top N% of sample beta-value is converted into 1. Or into 0.
        					Thus, "Negative" type means we count the number of beta-values not following the tendency of each CpG site's distribution for each sample.
        
        					If type is "Both", regardless of CpG site's skewedness top N/2% and bottom N/2% of sample beta-value is converted into 1. Or, into 0.
        					Thus, "Both" type means we count the number of strongly methylated or demethylated CpG sites for each sample.
        
        				By using this method, we can simply count the number of hypermethylated or hypomethylated CpG sites for the specific situation.
        				To explain this, let's take an example of cancer.
        					Globally, CpG sites are hypomethylated to increase chromosomal instability, by expressing retrotranspons(just one example).
        					But, CpG sites are hypermethylated near the promoter regions to silence life-critical genes.
        					So, If we use TopNpercentageCutoff Positive type method, we can count the number of these hypermethylated or hypomethylated CpG sites.
        					Then, we can correlate this values with the representative target genes' activity.
        
        				In short, we can analyze the epigenetic impact of diseases.

        					Fold change = Mean or Median of the representative target genes' activity of samples included in the section by percentage / Mean or Median of the representative target genes' activity of samples NOT included in the section by percentage.
