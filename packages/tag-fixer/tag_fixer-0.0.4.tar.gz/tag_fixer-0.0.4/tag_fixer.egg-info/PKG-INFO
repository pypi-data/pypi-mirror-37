Description: # Simple part of speech tag fixer
        
        ### These functions are designed to fix POS tags.
        ### For tag_fixer(), the presumed format of the data is a list of [word,tag] or (word,tag) pairs
            
            l = [["The","DT"],["teacher","NNP"],["is","VBZ"],["awesome","JJ"]]
            fixed_list = tag_fixer(l)
        
        ### For tag_fixer_sents(), the presumed format of that data is a list sentences that are lists of [word,tag] pairs.    
            
            l2 = [[["The","DT"],["teacher","NNP"],["is","VBZ"],["awesome","JJ"]],[["This","DT"],["is","VBZ"],["another","JJ"]]]
            tag_fixer_sents(l2)
        
        ### Note that either function will automatically capitalize tags (so the user doesn't have to hit the [shift] key)
