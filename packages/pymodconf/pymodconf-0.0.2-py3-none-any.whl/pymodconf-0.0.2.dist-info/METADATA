Modconf
========

|pipeline| |coverage|

This is a Python package which enables to modularize configuration files.

In configuration-based applications, it is sometimes desirable to group
sections in a configuration file. This can, for instance, be sections which are for a specific purpose, e.g. modules in
an application which shall be configurable.

For this purpose, *pymodconf* add the functionality to define custom ``Tag`` s representing groups in a configuration
file.
For instance, if you have an application with multiple modules you can define the tag ``Module:`` and add that prefix to
each section in the configuration file describing a certain module.

Installation
#############

You can find the latest version on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/pymodconf/>`_. So simply use ``pip`` with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pymodconf


Usage
######
This following configuration file shows the feature set of ``pymodconf``:

.. code-block:: ini

    1: [Application]
    2: name=pymodconf
    3: string=Hello ${name}!
    4: list=One, Two, Three, Four

    6: [Some Section]
    7: opt=${Application:name}-section

    9: [Module: Test]
    10:log-dir= /tmp/test_module


Sections
*********

In line ``[1]``  a new section ``Application`` is created with multiple options show in lines ``[2]-[3]``.

Variable replacement
*********************

Due to the fact that ``pymodconf`` is based on the ``configparser`` module, the variable-replacement feature is available,
too. In line ``[3]`` a reference to an option in the same section is shown. If you want to reference an option in any
other section, you'll have to specify the name of the section, as you can see in line ``[7]``.

Lists
******
If ``pymodconf`` finds any commata in the value of an option, it will split up that value and generate a list of it. In
line ``[4]`` the value is represented in Python as a list with four entries: 'One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four'.

Directory creation
*******************
Another feature of ``pymodconf`` is the automatic directory creation. If any option name ends with the suffix ``-dir`` it
will try to recursively create the directory tree. For instance, due to the definition in line ``[10]``, a directory
``test-module`` will be created in the directory ``/tmp/``.

Tagging
********

The most interesting feature of ``pymodconf`` is the ability to group sections using user-defined ``Tag`` s. As you
can see
in line ``[9]`` a section with the tag definition ``Module`` is defined.

Before ``pymodconf`` is able to group such sections, you'll have to register the tag at ``pymodconf`` with:

.. code-block:: python

    import pymodconf as mc

    module_tag = mc.tag.Tag('Module:')

    mc.tag.register(module_tag)

Afterwards, you can load the configuration file with:

.. code-block:: python

    config = mc.parser.load('example.cfg')

The result is dictionary with section names and user-defined modules as keys and the corresponding options as values.

You can, for instance, access the section belonging to the group ``Module`` either with:

.. code-block:: python

    config['module'] # returns [{'name': ' Test', 'log-dir': '/tmp/test_module'}]

or using the tag itself with:

.. code-block:: python

    config[str(module_tag)] # returns [{'name': ' Test', 'log-dir': '/tmp/test_module'}]
