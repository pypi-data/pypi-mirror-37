# Introduction

`dautil` stands for Data Analysis Utilities. It includes some of the routines I used for data analysis.

There's a companion repo called `dautil-sh`, scripts for similar purpose but use bash instead.

# Installation

1. Install the requirements from `requirements.txt`.

2. Add this directory to your `PYTHONPATH`.

3. Add `bin/` to your `PATH`.
