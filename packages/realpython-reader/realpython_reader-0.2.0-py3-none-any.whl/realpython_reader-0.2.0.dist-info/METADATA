    There are few guarantees in life: death, taxes, and programmers needing to
    deal with strings. Strings can come in many forms. They could be unstructured
    text, usernames, product descriptions, database column names, or really
    anything else that we describe using language.

    With the near-ubiquity of string data, it's important to master the tools of
    the trade when it comes to strings. Luckily, Python makes string manipulation
    very simple, especially when compared to other languages and even older
    versions of Python.
