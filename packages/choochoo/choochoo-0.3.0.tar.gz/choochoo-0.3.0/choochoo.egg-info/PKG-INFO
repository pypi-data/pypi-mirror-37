Description: 
        # choochoo (ch2)
        
        An **open**, **hackable** and **free** training diary.
        
        See [documentation](https://andrewcooke.github.io/choochoo/) for full
        details.
        
        Training data are stored in a database...
        
        * There are tools to get data into the database:
          * Read FIT files from smart watches, bike computers, etc
          * Daily information (eg weight) can be entered via the diary
            * Ability to add custom fields for general data capture
          * Other data (eg FTHR) can be entered at the command line
        * There are tools to process data in the database:
          * Prepared calculations for data totals, ranking, averages
          * Ability to extend processing with Python
        * There are tools to get data out of the database:
          * Browse and edit data in the diary
          * Pandas tables for analysis in numpy and Jupyter notebooks
          * Examples for plotting spatial and time-series data
        * Clear database schema, designed for third party access:
          * SQLAlchemy ORM interface
        
        The configuration is also stored in the database...
        
        * You can schedule training plans:
          * Prepared / example training plans included
          * Simple, declarative library for defining your own plans
        * You can add data fields to the diary
        * You can extend the statistics calculation pipeline
        
        The project can be used stand-alone by someone comfortable with the
        technologies used, or it could be extended with a GUI.
        
        ## Latest Changes
        
        ### v0.2.0
        
        Major rewrite to generalize the database schema.  Moved a lot of
        configuration into the database.  Now much more flexible, but less
        interactive.
