Description: # FCLI Foundational Components CLI
        - Helps spread the AwesomeSauce of the Foundational Components team a bit further.
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        - We recommend using Python 3.
        
        <code>
        cd fcli<br/>  
        
        python3.6 setup.py install<br/>
        </code>
        
        This will install the binary fcli in /usr/local/bin
        
        you will need to create a ~/.fcli file with your credentials similar to the fcli.ini in the root of this repo.
        
        ## Usage
        
        to add a task associated with a parent story-
        
        `fcli task "Task title" "Task description" <parent story ID>`
