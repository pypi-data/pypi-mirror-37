# ETH Zurich (IEF LAB): Python Lab Tools

This is a small library that uses Tkinter to provide a fast and easy method to build user interfaces for Lab Experiments.



## Introduction
In a lab environment it is often necessary to keep track of many experimental parameters in order to produce meaningful results. This library enables the user to build user interfaces really fast with some custom UI elements like plot controls, parameter tables or control panels. All controls are based on the controls of Tkinter which is a great UI library for python https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter.
