Except submitting kql queries, few other commands are included that may help using the Kqlmagic.<br>
- Only one command can be executed per magic transaction.<br>
- A command must start with a double hyphen-minus ```--```<br>
- If command is not specified, the default command ```"submit"``` is assumed, that submits the query.<br>

## Commands
The following commands are supported:<br>
- **submit** - Execute the query and return result. <br>
    - Options can be used to customize the behavior of the transaction.<br>
    - The query can parametrized.<br>
    - This is the default command.<br>
<br>

- **version** - Displays the current version string.<br>
<br>

- **usage** - Displays usage of Kqlmagic.<br>
<br>

- **help "topic"** - Display information about the topic.<br>
    - To get the list of all the topics, execute ```%kql --help "help"```<br>
<br>

## Examples:
```%kql --version```<br><br>
```%kql --usage```<br><br>
```%kql --help "help"```<br><br>
```%kql --help "options"```<br><br>
```%kql --help "conn"```<br><br>
```%kql --submit appinsights://appid='DEMO_APP';appkey='DEMO_KEY' pageViews | count```<br><br>
```%kql pageViews | count```

"""
_USAGE = """## Usage:
**line usage:** ```%kql [command] [conn] [result <<] [options] [query]```

**cell usage:** ```%%kql [conn] [result <<] [options] [query] [[EMPTY-LINE [result <<] [options]]*```<br>

- **command** - The command to be executed. 
    - If not specified the query will be submited, if exist.<br>

    - To get more information, execute ```%kql --help "commands"```<br>
<br>

- **conn** - Connection string or reference to a connection to Azure Monitor resource.<br>
    - If not specified the current (last created or used) connection will be used.<br>

<br>

- **query** - Kusto Query language (kql) query that will be submited to the specified connection or to the current connection.<br>

"""
_HELP_CONN = """## Overview
- To get data from Azure Monitor data resources, the user need to authenticate itself, and if it has the right permission, 
he would be able to query that data resource.
- The current supported data sources are: Azure Data Explorer (kusto) clusters, Application Insights, Log Analytics and Cache.
- Cache data source is not a real data source, it retrieves query results that were cached, but it can only retreive results queries that were executed before, new queries or modified queries won't work.
to get more information on cache data source, execute ```help "cache"```

- The user can connect to multiple data resources.
- Once a connection to a data resource is established, it gets a name of the form <resource>@<data-source>.
- Reference to a data resource can be by connection string, connection name, or current connection (last connection used).
    - If connection is not specified, current connection (last connection used) will be used.
    - To submit queries, at least one connection to a data resource must be established.

- When a connection is specified, and it is a new connection string, the authentication and authorization is validated authomatically, by submiting 
a validation query ```range c from 1 to 10 step 1 | count```, and if the correct result returns, the connection is established.

- An initial connection can be specified as an environment variable.
    - if specified it will be established when Kqlmagic loads.
    - The variable name is ```KQLMAGIC_CONNECTION_STR```

## Authentication methods:

* AAD Username/password - Provide your AAD username and password.
* AAD application - Provide your AAD tenant ID, AAD app ID and app secret.
* AAD code - Provide only your AAD username, and authenticate yourself using a code, generated by ADAL.
* certificate - Provide your AAD tenant ID, AAD app ID, certificate and certificate-thumbprint (supported only with Azure Data Explorer)
* appid/appkey - Provide you application insight appid, and appkey (supported only with Application Insights)

## Connect to Azure Data Explorere (kusto) data resource ```<database or alias>@<cluster>```
Few options to authenticate with Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) data resources:<br>
```%kql kusto://code;cluster='<cluster-name>';database='<database-name>';alias='<database-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql kusto://tenant='<tenant-id>';clientid='<aad-appid>';clientsecret='<aad-appkey>';cluster='<cluster-name>';database='<database-name>';alias='<database-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql kusto://tenant='<tenant-id>';certificate='<certificate>';certificate_thumbprint='<thumbprint>';cluster='<cluster-name>';database='<database-name>';alias='<database-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql kusto://tenant='<tenant-id>';certificate_pem_file='<pem_filename>';certificate_thumbprint='<thumbprint>';cluster='<cluster-name>';database='<database-name>';alias='<database-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql kusto://username='<username>';password='<password>';cluster='<cluster-name>';database='<database-name>';alias='<database-friendly-name>'```<br><br>

Notes:<br>
- username/password works only on corporate network.<br>
- alias is optional.<br>
- if credentials are missing, and a previous connection was established the credentials will be inherited.<br>
- if secret (password / clientsecret / thumbprint) is missing, user will be prompted to provide it.<br>
- if cluster is missing, and a previous connection was established the cluster will be inherited.<br>
- if tenant is missing, and a previous connection was established the tenant will be inherited.<br>
- if only the database change, a new connection can be set as follow: 
```<new-database-name>@<cluster-name>```<br>
- **a not quoted value, is a python expression, that is evaluated and its result is used as the value. This is how you can parametrize the connection string** 

## Connect to Log Analytics data resources ```<workspace or alias>@loganalytics```
Few options to authenticate with Log Analytics:<br>
```%kql loganalytics://code;workspace='<workspace-id>';alias='<workspace-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql loganalytics://tenant='<tenant-id>';clientid='<aad-appid>';clientsecret='<aad-appkey>';workspace='<workspace-id>';alias='<workspace-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql loganalytics://username='<username>';password='<password>';workspace='<workspace-id>';alias='<workspace-friendly-name>'```<br><br>

Notes:<br>
- authentication with appkey works only for the demo.<br>
- username/password works only on corporate network.<br>
- alias is optional.<br>
- if credentials are missing, and a previous connection was established the credentials will be inherited.<br>
- if secret (password / clientsecret) is missing, user will be prompted to provide it.<br>
- if tenant is missing, and a previous connection was established the tenant will be inherited.<br>
- **a not quoted value, is a python expression, that is evaluated and its result is used as the value. This is how you can parametrize the connection string**


## Connect to Application Insights data resources ```<appid or alias>@appinsights```
Few options to authenticate with Apllication Insights:<br><br>
```%kql appinsights://appid='<app-id>';appkey='<app-key>';alias='<appid-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql appinsights://code;appid='<app-id>';alias='<appid-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql appinsights://tenant='<tenant-id>';clientid='<aad-appid>';clientsecret='<aad-appkey>';appid='<app-id>';alias='<appid-friendly-name>'```<br><br>
```%kql appinsights://username='<username>';password='<password>';appid='<app-id>';alias='<appid-friendly-name>'```<br><br>

Notes:<br>
- username/password works only on corporate network.<br>
- alias is optional.<br>
- if credentials are missing, and a previous connection was established the credentials will be inherited.<br>
- if secret (password / clientsecret / appkey) is missing, user will be prompted to provide it.<br>
- if tenant is missing, and a previous connection was established the tenant will be inherited.<br>
- **a not quoted value, is a python expression, that is evaluated and its result is used as the value. This is how you can parametrize the connection string**
