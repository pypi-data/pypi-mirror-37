## Required libraries

```python
SciPy
NumPy
matplotlib
```


## Installation
As everything is just pure python, you don't really need to "install" at all. To be able to use the tools from anywhere on your system,
add the `aotools` directory to your `PYTHONTPATH`.
Alternatively you can use one of the methods below.

### Pip
AOtools can be installed using pip:

    pip install aotools

(which may require admin or root privileges)

### From Source
Alternatively, to install the tools to your system python distribution from source, run:

    python setup.py install

(which may require admin or root privileges) from the `aotools` directory.
