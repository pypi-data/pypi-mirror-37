Description: # Conveiro
        
        Conveiro is an open source library for feature visualization in deep convolutional networks. It implements multiple techniques for visualization, such as laplace, multiscale,  deep dream and CDFS.
        
        All of these methods are based on:
        * https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/ 
        * https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/deepdream/deepdream.ipynb
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Python 3.4 and above
        * Tensorflow (CPU or GPU variant)
        * Numpy
        * Matplotlib
        * OpenCV-Python
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install conveiro
        ```
        
        Development version
        
        ```
        pip install -e .    # from cloned repository
        ```
        
        ## Examples
        
        For examples how to use this library please take a look at jupyter notebooks in `docs/` folder:
        
        * https://github.com/Showmax/conveiro/tree/master/docs/deep_dream.ipynb
        * https://github.com/Showmax/conveiro/tree/master/docs/cdfs.ipynb
        
        Simplest example:
        
        ```python
        import tensorflow as tf
        import tensornets as nets
        from conveiro import cdfs
        
        input_t, decorrelated_image_t, coeffs_t = cdfs.setup(224)
        
        model = nets.Inception1(input_t)
        graph = tf.get_default_graph()
        
        with tf.Session() as sess:
            sess.run(model.pretrained())
        
            objective = graph.get_tensor_by_name("inception1/block3b/concat:0")
            image = cdfs.render_image(sess, decorrelated_image_t, coeffs_t, objective[..., 55], 0.01)
            cdfs.show_image(cdfs.process_image(image))
        ```
