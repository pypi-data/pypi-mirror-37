Description: Binah
        =====
        
        Binah is a system for training multi-modal embeddings jointly. We develop
        an image embedding and a text embedding where objects of similar abstract 
        meaning are near each other in a shared vector space. With this we are 
        able create image and video search using arbitrary language.

        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            pip install binah
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        Binah comes bundled with the etz command line tool.
        
        To completely set up the project, simply run:
        
        ::
        
            etz up
        
        This command sets up the whole Binah system de novo. It takes days to 
        run since it downloads datasets and trains complicated deep learning 
        models.
        
        After "etz up" is finished you can start the image search web demo.
        Simply run:
        
        ::
        
            etz run search
