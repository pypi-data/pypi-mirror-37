Description: # Nightly
        
        Nightly is a simple utility for executing a command every evening. Think of it as a poor person's Cron that only does one thing with a less-flexible scheduling system. I built this to handle kicking off automated scripts inside a few Docker projects.
        
        ## Requirements:
        
        * Python 3.6+
        * Python pip
        
        ## Installation:
        
        ```sh
        pip install nightly
        ```
        
        ## Usage:
        
        The following will run `/path/to/script.sh` every day at 4am:
        
        ```sh
        # nightly --when 4:00 /path/to/script.sh
        ```
