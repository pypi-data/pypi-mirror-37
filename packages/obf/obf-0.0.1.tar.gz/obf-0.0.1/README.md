# *obf* - an obfuscation tool and library

*obf* is designed to obfuscate an input document, whilst ensuring that the output is still (somewhat) human-readable and 
while also maintaining consistency of mapping between an input plaintext and an obfuscated output, such that 
obf(plaintext) always yields the same result.

This latter characteristic means that *obf* is not really suitable for strong encryption, as frequency analysis of the 
output ciphertext, perhaps with the assistance of a crib, could make the output comprehensible to an attacker.

The intent of *obf* is to allow the sharing of potentially sensitive data outside of a protected zone while ensuring 
it's continued consistency, and thus operability without requiring any changes to other tools and tooling.

*obf* was developed as a tool to allow the copying of data (files and databases) from a protected "green" network to 
unprotected "red" zones, including developer workstations and laptops while maintaining reasonable data privacy. *obf* 
is intended to be used either as a standalone tool or as a library in an automated data-copy process.  

**Installation instructions**
-----------------------------
*obf* is written in Python, and you can use the pip installer to install it thus:

```
$ pip install obf
```

**Usage**
---------
`obf [-h] [-b [blockedwords file]] [-c [C]] [-n [N]] [plaintext]`



*positional arguments:*

`plaintext`            A plaintext to obfuscate.

*optional arguments:*

`  -h, --help `           show this help message and exit

`  -b [blockedwords file]`
                        A file containing specific words to block. If missing
                        the entire input is obfuscated.
                        
`  -c [C] `              Display a crib showing the mapping of blocked values
                        to their obfuscated values. Only works when a specific
                        blockfile is used with the -b option.
                        
  `-n [N]`              An index to indicate which bytes of the generated hash
                        to use as a lookup into the codewords file. Defaults
                        to 4.

If no plaintext is provided, then obf will look at stdin instead.

**Examples**

$ obf hello

This is a sample file that holds some secrets. For example, both DREAMING and STIRRING are examples of a FRETS PEMMICAN.
Similarly you'd expect that their email addresses DREAMING@CORPULENCE.com and STIRRING@CORPULENCE.com should be considered secrets.
