# requirements:
# 1. a plaintext word always maps to the same codeword
# 2. it is extremely unlikely that two different plaintext words map to the same codeword
# 3. it is extremely difficult to reverse-engineer a plaintext word from a codeword without a crib

# Firstly we clearly need more codewords available to choose from than we have plaintext words.
# We achieve this by taking a one-way hash of the plaintext, and choosing the last n digits of this as the "effective
# hash".  We then use this "effective hash" as a lookup into a list of codewords.  We employ modulus looping to ensure
# that we can always return a codeword, but this is a safety precaution only as any modulus looping increases the
# likelihood of a collision of codewords.  As long as we have more codewords available than the length of the effective
# hash permits, we can avoid this increase in collision probability. If we have a dictionary of >=65535 codewords, then
# we should pick our effective hash to be 4 bytes long.
