Description: # vinyldns-python (WORK IN PROGRESS)
        
        Python client library for [VinylDNS](https://www.vinyldns.io/)
        
        This project is a work in progress! If you would like to help us get this where it needs to be,
        please reach out to us in [gitter](https://gitter.im/vinyldns/Lobby).
        
        To run, `pip install vinyldns-python` and then:
        
        ```python
        >>> from vinyldns_python import *
        >>> local_client = client.VinylDNSClient("ApiEndpoint", "UserAccessKey", "UserSecretKey")
        >>> local_client.list_zones()
        ```
        
        ## Local Development
        See the [quickstart](https://github.com/vinyldns/vinyldns/blob/master/README.md#quickstart) in the
        VinylDNS api for details on how to start up a local instance of the api in docker. With that
        running, you can make requests with the following client details:
        ```python
        local_client = client.VinylDNSClient("http://localhost:9000", "okAccessKey", "okSecretKey")
        ```
