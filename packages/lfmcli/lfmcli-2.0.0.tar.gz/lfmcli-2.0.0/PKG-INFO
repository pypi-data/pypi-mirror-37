        The Flow Manager client can be used as either library for packages

        Installation
        ------------
        
        This library needs to be packaged into a source distribution and then
        copied into a location that allows one of the packages that use it to
        include it (i.e. on a web server like nginx).
        
        Creating the source distribution
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Need to do the following to create source distribution
        
        1. Run the following command to make a source distribution
        
        ::
        
            $ make sdist
        
        2. Copy the resulting distribution to a web server
        
        ::
        
            $ cd dist
            $ scp lfm-cli-2.0.0.tar.gz <webserver>:/web/dir
        
        Running the tests
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        tests can be run on the package to ensure nothing has been broken
        
        ::
        
            $ make test
