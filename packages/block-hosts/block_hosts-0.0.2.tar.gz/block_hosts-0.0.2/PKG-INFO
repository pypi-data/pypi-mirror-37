        ## Usage
        
        The simplest and most common usage of Block is to block all sites in a curated list. To do this, run the following command in the console:
        
        ```
        $ block curated
        ```
        
        and to unblock, run:
        
        ```
        $ block unblock
        ```
        
        To block a single web site, run:
        
        ```
        $ block website_url
        ```
        
        where *website_url* refers to, you guessed it, the URL of the website you want to block. To reverse the action, run
        
        ```
        $ block unblock website_url
        ```
        
        Note: modifying the hosts file requires administrator privileges, so make sure that the terminal is in elevated mode.
        
        Another note: you might need to restart the browser for changes to take effect.
