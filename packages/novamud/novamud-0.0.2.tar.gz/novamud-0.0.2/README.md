# Novamud

A very simple and flexible MUD framework built to work with websockets.
Dungeons can be built with pure python in very simple classes. 

See `example_dungeon.py` for a very simple example with a few rooms. Run
the server with `python example_dungeon.py` and visit client.html in a
web browser to see it in action.
