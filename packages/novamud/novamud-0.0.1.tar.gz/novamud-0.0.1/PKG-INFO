Description: # Novamud
        
        A very simple and flexible MUD framework built to work with websockets.
        Dungeons can be built with pure python in very simple classes. 
        
        See `example_dungeon.py` for a very simple example with a few rooms. Run
        the server with `python example_dungeon.py` and visit client.html in a
        web browser to see it in action.
