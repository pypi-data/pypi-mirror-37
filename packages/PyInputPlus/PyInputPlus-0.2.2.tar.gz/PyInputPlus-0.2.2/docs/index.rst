About
=====

PyInputPlus is a Python 2 and 3 module to provide input()- and raw_input()-like functions with additional validation features.

This module relies heavily on PySimpleValidate (also by Al) for the actual
validation. PyInputPlus provides interaction with the user through stdin/stdout
while PySimpleValidate provides the functions that validate the user's input.
