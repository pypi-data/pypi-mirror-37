Description: =============================================
        **dbversions** - Database Versioning with Git
        =============================================
         
        **dbversions** is a python software package which helps to keep distinct 
        database versions for various branches and commits of a git repository.
        
        The different versions are kept by database dumps at specific commits and 
        databases are brought up to the latest status by executing the db scripts
        committed within a specific branch.
        
        Please find the documentation for the tool under: manual_
        
        The code is available on GitHub: Please feel free to take also a look onto it or
        contribute if suitable: github_
