Description: # pylintconfig
        
        pylint is a great linter, which thoroughly analyses your code. Running it for the first time on an existing codebase can be intimidating though, because it outputs hundreds of errors! Through all the errors, you don't see the important ones and skip pylint alltogether.
        
        pylintconfig is a small cli which makes it easier to implement pylint in an existing codebase. It helps creating a configuration file which checks the errors you find important and skips the rest.
        
        # Install
        ```
        pip install pylintconfig
        ```
        
        # Basic usage
        ```
        pylintconfig disable MODULES_OR_PACKAGES
        ```
        Or when you want to immediately save the config:
        
        ```
        pylintconfig disable MODULES_OR_PACKAGES > .pylintrc
        ```
        
        # Future plans
        - Add tests
        - Load current pylintrc file
        - Add ignore command, which make it easy to ignore specific files
