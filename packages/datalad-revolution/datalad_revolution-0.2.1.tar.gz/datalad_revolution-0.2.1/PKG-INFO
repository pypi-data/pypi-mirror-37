Description: Revolutionary DataLad extension
        ===============================
        
        `Travis tests
        status <https://travis-ci.org/datalad/datalad-revolution>`__ `Build
        status <https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mih/datalad-revolution>`__
        `codecov.io <https://codecov.io/github/datalad/datalad-revolution?branch=master>`__
        
        This repository contains a `DataLad <http://datalad.org>`__ extension
        that equips DataLad with new core commands that are potentially faster,
        or just better looking. Moreover, it enhanced the core dataset and
        repository abstraction classes with additional functionality that is
        written with enhanced cross-platform compatibility and speed in mind.
        
        Additional commands
        
        -  ``rev-status`` – like ``git status``, but simpler and working with
           dataset hierarchies
        -  ``rev-save`` – a 2-in-1 replacement for ``save`` and ``add``
        -  ``rev-create`` – a faster ``create``
        
        Additional base class functionality
        
        -  ``GitRepo.status()``
        -  ``GitRepo.diff()``
        -  ``GitRepo.annexstatus()``
        
        Path handling in all additional functionality is using the ``pathlib``
        module.
