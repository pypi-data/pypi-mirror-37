proxTV is a toolbox implementing blazing fast implementations of Total Variation
proximity operators. While the core algorithms are implemented in C to achieve high
efficiency, Matlab and Python interfaces are provided for ease of use. The library
provides efficient solvers for a variety of Total Variation proximity problems, with
address input signals of any dimensionality (1d, images, video, ...) and different
norms to apply in the Total Variation term.
