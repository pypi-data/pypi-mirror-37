    The openstacksdk dependency lists ``>=0.9.19``, however the **ACTUAL**
    lower-bound is ``0.11.2``, which is the version of openstacksdk released
    with Queens. Since the dependency does not have an upper bound, installing
    shade from pip will result in the correct thing.

    In preparation for being a compat layer during the Rocky timeframe, shade
    now depends on openstacksdk and gets all of its dependencies as transitive
    depends through openstacksdk. Subsequent shade releases will begin
    replacing code inside of shade and will instead call the openstacksdk
    copies of the relevant code. The shade backwards compat contract remains
    in place and users should not notice any regressions.
