### [Unreleased]

...


### v0.2.0rc1 [2018-10-28]

#### Added

 * "Misc" token type, '&', matching arbitrary non-whitespace content
 * Optional whitespace can now be specified after number, literal, and misc
   tokens, in addition to 'required whitespace after' and
   'no whitespace after'
 * New helper function `column_stack_2d`
   * Needs performance improvements for large arrays
 * New 'optional line' token type
   * Works irregularly, perhaps due to quirks in managing optional
     groups/capture groups within the Python regex engine?
 * New property flags on `Token` to indicate the new features added
   ('misc' token type, optional-whitespace-after, etc.)

#### Changed

 * Switched certain lists within the `Parser.capture_struct` return
   dict structure to a type that automatically passes through a dict key to the
   single element of those lists, if they are length-one. This
   simplifies the syntax of a number of use cases by eliminating explicit `[0]`
   indexing.
 * `Parser` instances now syntax-check their `head`/`body`/`tail` patterns
   at instantiation, instead of at the first capture attempt.


### v0.1.0 [2018-09-23]

#### Features

 * Three token types implemented to date: numeric, string-literal, "any"
 * Parsing of multiple levels of recursive nested data; tested only
   to two leves of nesting to date.
 * Each nested level of structure can have head/body/tail
 * Captured tokens can be easily retrieved from head/tail at the top level
   parser; no good head or tail capture yet from within nested structures
