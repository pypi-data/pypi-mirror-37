Dear readers
############

Hello everyone. I'm Kazunari, the author of Harvester.

Since I opened the source code of Harvester in May 2018, so many people visited our website and left their very positive messages about Harvester. The number was much more than I expected what I had in the beginning and it truly was one of the exciting experiences I ever had in my professional career.

The original motivation that drove myself to develop Harvester was I didn't know how to develop any image acquisition consumer library though I had been involved in the machine vision market for some reasonable years. Until I got the idea of Harvester, I had to learn and adapt to popular proprietary 3rd party image acquisition libraries from scratch every time even though I just wanted to get an image to manipulate it; to be honest, I had felt it's a bit ridiculous and that exactly was the place where Harvester should came: I needed a unified image acquisition library. In addition, I also needed Python to gain the productivity.

I believe Harvester can help you to concentrate on image processing that you really had to. Of course, you may have to implement the algorithm again using other proprietary libraries to optimize the performance. However, Harvester doesn't intend to take the place of such superior libraries because they were designed for exactly that purpose. Harvester just wants to shorten the time you spend to realize your brilliant ideas as much as possible. Fortunately, Harvester has got firm support from the high-quality GenTL Producers in the market. It means you can smoothly start working with any GenICam compliant cameras that you may want to work with.

So everyone, there's no worry anymore. Keep having fun for working. Harvester has got your back.

About Harvester
###############

Harvester was created to be a friendly image acquisition library for all people who those want to learn computer/machine vision. Harvester consists of two Python libraries, Harvester Core and Harvester GUI, and technically speaking, each library is responsible for the following tasks:

- Harvester Core: Image acquisition & device manipulation
- Harvester GUI: Image data visualization

Harvester consumes image acquisition libraries, so-called GenTL Producers. Just grabbing a GenTL Producer and GenICam compliant machine vision cameras, then Harvester will supply you the acquired image data as `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ array to make your image processing task productive.

You can freely use, modify, distribute Harvester under `Apache License-2.0 <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_ without worrying about the use of your software: personal, internal or commercial.

Currently, Harvester is being developed by the motivated contributors from all over the world.

************************************
Harvester... where is the name from?
************************************

Harvester's name was coming from the great Flemish painter, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's painting so-called "The Harvesters". You can see the painting in the top of this page. Harvesters harvest a crop every season that has been fully grown and the harvested crop is passed to the consumers. On the other hand, image acquisition libraries acquire images as their crop and the images are passed to the following processes. We found the similarity between them and decided to name our library Harvester.

Apart from anything else, we love its peaceful and friendly name. We hope you also like it ;-)

Development status
******************

The Harvester project has started since April 2018 and it's still under development as of October 2018 but many developers and researchers over the world have already confirmed that it is actually usable with the popular GenTL Producers and GenICam compliant cameras from the following companies. We have realized the progress had been brought by all interested people's positive expectation in the machine vision market and we strongly believe it will sustain to the following years. Of course, we will never forget the importance of volunteer companies which provided us their products to test Harvester. Thank you very much! Harvester is here for you all! And again, Harvester is still under development so please check out the latest version when you make a try.

You might be able to directly download one at their website but please note that perhaps some of them could require you to register your information to get one. In addition, some GenTL Producers might block you to connect other competitors' cameras.

###########
Terminology
###########

Before start talking about the detail, let's take a look at some important terminologies that frequently appear in this document. These terminologies are listed as follows:

* **The GenApi-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with the GenICam reference implementation.

* **A GenTL Producer**: A library that has C interface and offers consumers a way to communicate with cameras over physical transport layer dependent technology hiding the detail from the consumer.

* **The GenTL-Python Binding**: A Python module that communicates with GenTL Producers.

* **Harvester**: A Python module that consists of Harvester Core and Harvester GUI.

* **Harvester Core**: A part of Harvester that works as an image acquisition engine.

* **Harvester GUI**: A part of Harvester that works as a graphical user interface of Harvester Core.

* **A GenICam compliant device**: It's typically a camera. Just involving the GenICam reference implementation, it offers consumers a way to dynamically configure/control the target devices.

The following diagram shows the hierarchy and relationship of the relevant modules:

############
Installation
############

In this section, we will learn how to instruct procedures to get Harvester work.

*******************
System Requirements
*******************

The following software modules are required to get Harvester working:

* Either of Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7 (Only 64bit versions are supported as of October 2018.)

In addition, please note that we don't supported Cygwin on Windows. This restriction is coming from a fact that the GenICam reference implementation has not supported it.

In addition, you will need the following items to let Harvester make something meaningful:

* GenTL Producers
* GenICam compliant machine vision cameras

***************************
Certified operating systems
***************************

Harvester has been confirmed it works with the following 64-bit operating systems:

* Fedora 27
* macOS 10.13
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation 7.4
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Windows 7
* Windows 10

*************************
Installing Harvester Core
*************************

You can install Harvester via PyPI invoking the following command; note that the package name is ``harvesters`` but not ``harvester``; unfortunately, the latter word had been reserved:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install harvesters

For people who those have already installed it:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install --upgrade harvesters

Or more simply:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install -U harvesters

Perhaps ``pip`` could install cached package. If you want to install the newly dowloaded package, you should invoke the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install -U --no-cache-dir harvesters

These commands will automatically install the required modules such as ``numpy`` or ``genicam2`` (the Python Binding for the GenICam GenApi & the GenTL Producers) if the module has not yet installed on your environment.

Getting back to the original topic, you could install the latest development version it using ``setup.py`` cloning Harvester from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/genicam/harvesters.git && cd harvesters && python setup.py install

################################
How does Harvester Core help us?
################################

Harvester Core is an image acquisition engine. No GUI. You can use it as an image acquisition library which acquires images from GenTL Producers through the GenTL-Python Binding and controls the target device (it's typically a camera) through the GenApi-Python Binding.

Harvester Core works as a minimalistic front-end for image acquisition. Just importing it from your Python script, you should immediately be able to set images on your table.

You'll be able to download the these language binding runtime libraries from the `EMVA website <https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/genicam/genicam-downloads/>`_, however, it's not available as of May 2018, because they have not officially released yet. Fortunately they are in the final reviewing process so hopefully they'll be released by the end of 2018.

If you don't have to care about the display rate for visualizing acquired images, the combination of Harvester Core and `Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_ might be a realistic option for that purpose.

*********************************
Tasks Harvester Core does for you
*********************************

The main features of Harvester Core are listed as follows:

* Image acquisition through GenTL Producers
* Multiple loading of GenTL Producers in a single Python script
* GenICam feature node manipulation of the target device

Note that the second item implies you can involve multiple types of transport layers in your Python script. Each transport layer has own advantages and disadvantages and you should choose appropriate transport layers following your application's requirement. You just need to acquire images for some purposes and the GenTL Producers deliver the images somehow. It truly is the great benefit of the GenTL Standard! And of course, not only GenTL Producers but Harvester Core offer you a way to manipulate multiple devices in a single Python script with an intuitive manner.

On the other hand, Harvester Core could be considered as a simplified version of the GenTL-Python Binding; actually, Harvester Core hides it in its back and shows only intuitive interfaces to its clients. Harvester Core just offers you a relationship between you and a device. Nothing more. We say it again, just you and a device. If you need to manipulate more relevant GenTL modules or have to achieve something over a hardcore way, then you should directly work with the GenTL-Python Binding.

******************************************
Pixel formats that Harvester Core supports
******************************************

Currently, Harvester Core supports the following pixel formats that are defined by the Pixel Format Naming Convention:

    ``Mono8``, ``Mono10``, ``Mono12``, ``Mono16``, ``RGB8``, ``RGBa8``, ``BayerRG8``, ``BayerGR8``, ``BayerBG8``, ``BayerGB8``, ``BayerRG16``, ``BayerGR16``, ``BayerBG16``, ``BayerGB16``

###########
Screenshots
###########

*************************
Harvester Core on IPython
*************************

The following screenshot shows Harvester Core is running on IPython. An acquired image is delivered as the payload of a buffer and the buffer can be fetched by calling the ``fetch_buffer`` method of the ``ImageAcquirer`` class. Once you get an image you should be able to immediately start image processing. If you're running on the Jupyter notebook, you should be able to visualize the image data using Matplotlib. This step should be helpful to check what's going on your trial in the image processing flow.

Using Harvester Core
####################

First, let's import Harvester:

.. code-block:: python

    from harvesters.core import Harvester

Then instantiate a Harvester object; we're going to use ``h`` that stands for
Harvester as its identifier.

.. code-block:: python

    h = Harvester()

And load a CTI file; loading a CTI file, you can communicate with the GenTL
Producer:

.. code-block:: python

    h.add_cti_file('path/to/gentl_producer.cti')

Note that you can add **one or more CTI files** on a single Harvester Core object. To add another CTI file, just repeat calling ``add_cti_file`` method passing another target CTI file:

.. code-block:: python

    h.add_cti_file('path/to/another_gentl_producer.cti')

And the following code will let you know the CTI files that have been loaded
on the Harvester object:

.. code-block:: python

    h.cti_files

In a contrary sense, you can remove a specific CTI file that you have added with the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    h.remove_cti_file('path/to/gentl_producer.cti')

And now yol have to update the list of devices; it fills up your device
information list and you'll select a device to control from the list:

.. code-block:: python

    h.update_device_info_list()

The following code will let you know the devices that you can control:

.. code-block:: python

    h.device_info_list

Our friendly GenTL Producer, so called TLSimu, gives you the following information:

.. code-block:: python

    [(unique_id='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0', version='1.2.3'),
     (unique_id='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_1', version='1.2.3'),
     (unique_id='TLSimuMono', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuMono', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_0', version='1.2.3'),
     (unique_id='TLSimuColor', vendor='EMVA_D', model='TLSimuColor', tl_type='Custom', user_defined_name='Center', serial_number='SN_InterfaceB_1', version='1.2.3')]

And you create an image acquirer object specifying a target device. The image acquirer does the image acquisition task for you. In the following example it's trying to create an acquirer object of the first candidate device in the device information list:

.. code-block:: python

    ia = h.create_image_acquirer(0)

Or equivalently:

.. code-block:: python

    ia = h.create_image_acquirer(list_index=0)

You can connect the same device passing more unique information to the method such as:

.. code-block:: python

    mono_a = h.create_image_acquirer(serial_number='SN_InterfaceA_0')

We named the acquirer object ``ia`` in the above example but in a practical occasion, you may name it like just ``camera``, ``mono_cam``, or ``face_detection_cam`` more specifically even though those entities don't acquire images by themselves but they transfer images that will be acquired by their image acquirer.

Anyway, then now we start image acquisition:

.. code-block:: python

    ia.start_image_acquisition()

Once you started image acquisition, you should definitely want to get an image. Images are delivered to the acquirer allocated buffers. To fetch a buffer that has been filled up with an image, you can have 2 options; the first option is to use the ``with`` statement:

.. code-block:: python

    with ia.fetch_buffer() as buffer:
        # Work with the Buffer object. It consists of everything you need.
        print(buffer)
        # The buffer will automatically be queued.

Having that code, the fetched buffer is automatically queued once the code step out from the scope of the ``with`` statement. It's prevents you to forget queueing it by accident. The other option is to manually queue the fetched buffer by yourself:

.. code-block:: python

    buffer = ia.fetch_buffer()
    print(buffer)
    # Don't forget to queue the buffer.
    buffer.queue()

In this option, again, please do not forget that you have to queue the buffer by yourself. If you forget queueing it, then you'll lose a buffer that could be used for image acquisition. Everything is up to your design, so please choose an appropriate way for you. In addition, once you queued the buffer, the Buffer object will be obsolete. There's nothing to do with it.

Okay, then you would stop image acquisition with the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    ia.stop_image_acquisition()

And the following code disconnects the connecting device from the image acquirer; you'll have to create an image acquirer object again when you have to work with a device:

.. code-block:: python

    ia.destroy()

Now you can quit the program! Please not that the image acquirer also supports the ``with`` statement. So you may write program as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    with h.create_image_acquirer(0) as ia:
        # Work, work, and work with the ia object.

    # the ia object will automatically call the destroy method.

***********************
Reshaping a NumPy array
***********************

We have learned how to acquire images from a target device through an `ImageAcquirer` class object. In this section, we will learn how to reshape the acquired image into another that can be used by your application.

First, you should know that Harvester Core returns you an image as a 1D NumPy array.

.. code-block:: python

    buffer = ia.fetch_buffer()
    _1d = buffer.payload.components[0].data

Perhaps you may expect to have it as a 2D array but Harvester Core doesn't in reality because if Harvester Core provides an image as a specific shape, then it could limit your algorithm that you can apply to get the image that fits to your expected shape. Instead, Harvester Core provides you an image as a 1D array and also provides you required information that you would need while you're reshaping the original array to another.

The following code is an except from Harvester GUI that reshapes the source 1D array to another to draw it on the VisPy canvas. VisPy canvas takes `content` as an image to draw:

.. code-block:: python

    from harvesters.util.pfnc import mono_location_formats, \
        rgb_formats, bgr_formats, \
        rgba_formats, bgra_formats

    payload = buffer.payload
    component = payload.components[0]
    width = component.width
    height = component.height

    # Reshape the image so that it can be drawn on the VisPy canvas:
    if data_format in mono_location_formats:
        content = component.data.reshape(height, width)
    else:
        # The image requires you to reshape it to draw it on the
        # canvas:
        if data_format in rgb_formats or \
                data_format in rgba_formats or \
                data_format in bgr_formats or \
                data_format in bgra_formats:
            #
            content = component.data.reshape(
                height, width,
                int(component.num_components_per_pixel)  # Set of R, G, B, and Alpha
            )
            #
            if data_format in bgr_formats:
                # Swap every R and B:
                content = content[:, :, ::-1]
        else:
            return

Note that `component.num_components_per_pixel` returns a `float` so please don't forget to cast it when you pass it to the `reshape` method of NumPy array. If you try to set a `float` then the method will refuse it.

Sometimes you may have to handle image formats that require you to newly create another image calculating each pixel component value referring to the pixel location. To help such calculation, `Component2DImage` class provides the `represent_2d_pixel_location` method to tell you the 2D pixel location that corresponds to the pixel format. The pixel location is defined by Pixel Format Naming Convention, PFNC in short. The array that is returned by the method is a 2D NumPy array and it corresponds to the model that is defined by PFNC.

.. code-block:: python

    pixel_location = component.represent_2d_pixel_location()

For example, if you acquired an image in YUV 4:2:2 format, then the 1st and the 2nd rows of `pixel_location` would look as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    [Y11, U11, Y12, V11, Y13, U13, Y14, V13, ...]
    [Y21, U21, Y22, V21, Y23, U23, Y24, V23, ...]

Having that pixel location, you should be able to convert the color space from YUV to RGB.

You can download the standard document of PFNC at the `EMVA website <https://www.emva.org/standards-technology/genicam/genicam-downloads/>`_.

The initial idea about Harvester suddenly came up to a software engineer, Kazunari Kudo's head in the early April of year 2018 and he immediately decided to bring the first prototype to the International Vision Standards Meeting, IVSM in short, that was going to be held in Frankfurt am Main in the following early May. During the Frankfurt IVSM, interested engineers tried out Harvester and confirmed it really worked using commercial machine vision cameras provided by well-known machine vision camera manufacturers in the world. Having that fact, the attendees of the IVSM warmly welcomed Harvester.
