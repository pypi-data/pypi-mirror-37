"""
A :std:doc:`dimod composite <dimod:reference/samplers>` that tiles small problems
multiple times to a Chimera-structured sampler.

The :class:`.TilingComposite` takes a problem that can fit on a small
:std:doc:`Chimera <system:reference/intro>` graph and replicates it across a larger
Chimera graph to obtain samples from multiple areas of the solver in one call.
For example, a 2x2 Chimera lattice could be tiled 64 times (8x8) on a fully-yielded
D-Wave 2000Q system (16x16).

See `Ocean Glossary <https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/glossary.html>`_ for explanations
of technical terms in descriptions of Ocean tools.

class TilingComposite(dimod.Sampler, dimod.Composite, dimod.Structured):
    """Composite to tile a small problem across a Chimera-structured sampler.

    Inherits from :class:`dimod.Sampler`, :class:`dimod.Composite`, and :class:`dimod.Structured`.

    Enables parallel sampling for small problems (problems that are minor-embeddable in
    a small part of a D-Wave solver's :std:doc:`Chimera <system:reference/intro>` graph).

    The notation *CN* refers to a Chimera graph consisting of an NxN grid of unit cells.
    Each Chimera unit cell is itself a bipartite graph with shores of size t. The D-Wave 2000Q QPU
    supports a C16 Chimera graph: its 2048 qubits are logically mapped into a 16x16 matrix of
    unit cell of 8 qubits (t=4).

    A problem that can be minor-embedded in a single unit cell, for example, can therefore
    be tiled across the unit cells of a D-Wave 2000Q as 16x16 duplicates. This enables
    sampling 256 solutions in a single call.

    Args:
       sampler (:class:`dimod.Sampler`): Structured dimod sampler to be wrapped.
       sub_m (int): Number of rows of Chimera unit cells for minor-embedding the problem once.
       sub_n (int): Number of columns of Chimera unit cells for minor-embedding the problem once.
       t (int, optional, default=4): Size of the shore within each Chimera unit cell.

    Examples:
       This example instantiates a composed sampler using composite :class:`.TilingComposite`
       to tile a QUBO problem on a D-Wave solver, embedding it with composite
       :class:`.EmbeddingComposite` and selecting the D-Wave solver with the user's
       default :std:doc:`D-Wave Cloud Client configuration file <cloud-client:reference/intro>`.
       The two-variable QUBO represents a
       logical NOT gate (two nodes with biases of -1 that are coupled with strength 2) and is
       easily minor-embedded in a single Chimera cell (it needs only any two coupled qubits) and
       so can be tiled multiple times across a D-Wave solver for parallel solution (the two
       nodes should typically have opposite values).
