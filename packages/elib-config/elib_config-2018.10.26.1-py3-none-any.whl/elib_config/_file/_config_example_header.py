HEADER = r'''This is an example configuration file for {app_name}.

Version: {app_version}.

WARNING: this example file will be overwritten every time {app_name} starts.
Make sure to save your work and rename the file when you are done!

It must be renamed to "{config_file_path}" in order to come into effect.

The configuration file follows the TOML format specification.

Mandatory and optional values
=============================

Some values are mandatory, some aren't. Mandatory values are marked with the "MANDATORY VALUE" tag. If mandatory values
are missing, {app_name} will not start.

Note that, while not necessary for {app_name} to function, failing to provide non-mandatory values may prevent 
non-essential modules to start.

OS environment
==============

All configuration values may also be given using the OS environment instead of the config file. However, 
the "{app_name}_" prefix must be added (this is to prevent any potential conflict with other application.

For example, the configuration "dummy_key: dummy_value" would be set in the OS environment using the variable
"{app_name}_DUMMY_KEY=dummy_value".

Values types
=============

Value types will be checked at runtime.

TOML specification
