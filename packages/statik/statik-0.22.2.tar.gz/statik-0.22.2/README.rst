Statik
======

Overview
--------

**Statik** aims to be a simple, yet powerful, generic static web site
generator. Instead of forcing you to adhere to a particular data
structure/model (like the standard blog data model, with posts, pages
and tags), **Statik** allows you to define your own data models in YAML
format, and instances of those data models either in YAML or Markdown.
This is all loaded into an in-memory
`SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`__ SQLite database when
rendering your *views*.

Then, code up your templates using the
`Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`__ templating engine (very similar to
the Django templating engine), or
`Mustache <http://mustache.github.io/>`__ templates.

Finally, define your *views* (either complex or simple) in YAML format,
telling **Statik** how to render your data and templates to specific
URLs for your shiny new static web site. Write queries for your views in
SQLAlchemy's `ORM
syntax <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/orm/tutorial.html>`__, or
`MLAlchemy <https://github.com/thanethomson/MLAlchemy>`__ to make your
life easier.

See the `wiki <https://github.com/thanethomson/statik/wiki>`__ for more
details.

Requirements
------------

In order to install **Statik**, you will need:

-  Python 2.7+ or Python 3.5+
-  ``pip`` or ``easy_install``

Installation
------------

Simply run the following:

.. code:: bash

    > pip install statik

To upgrade, just run the following:

.. code:: bash

    > pip install --upgrade statik

Usage
-----

To build the project in the current directory, writing output files to
the ``public`` directory within the current directory:

.. code:: bash

    > statik

To build a project in another directory, writing output files to the
``public`` directory within *that* directory:

.. code:: bash

    > statik -p /path/to/project/folder

To build a project in another directory, with control over where to
place the output files:

.. code:: bash

    > statik -p /path/to/project/folder -o /path/to/output/folder

Project QuickStart
------------------

To create an empty project folder with the required project structure,
simply run:

.. code:: bash

    > statik -p /path/to/project/ --quickstart

Statik Projects
---------------

A **Statik** project must adhere to the directory structure as follows:

::

    config.yml    - YAML configuration file for the overall project.
    assets/       - Static assets for the project (images, CSS files,
                    scripts, etc.). Ignored if themes are used.
    data/         - Instances for each of the different models, defined either in
                    YAML or Markdown format.
    models/       - A folder specifically dedicated to model definitions, in YAML
                    format.
    templates/    - Jinja2 template files. Ignored if themes are used.
    templatetags/ - Python scripts defining custom Jinja2 template tags and
                    filters.
    themes/       - If your project uses themes, place them here. Each theme
                    must be uniquely named, and must contain an "assets"
                    and "templates" folder.
    views/        - Configuration files, in YAML format, defining "recipes" for how
                    to generate various different URLs (which models to use, which
                    data and which templates).

For example projects, see the ``examples`` directory in the source
repository. For more information, see the
`wiki <https://github.com/thanethomson/statik/wiki>`__.
