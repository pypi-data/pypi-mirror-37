Hektor QTI-XML to JSON converter
--------------------------------

This small converter should convert an Ilias export into somthing more readable,
like a json file. The main consumers of these files will be Grady or other
applications that do not want to deal with the QTI mess.

The name Hektor is taken from Homer's Iilas. Despite being the greatest warrior
of Troja he met his doom in the Ilias. Anyone who works with the E-Learning
Platform Ilias shall be equally doomed.

Installation:
    - `pip install -U hektor`

Usage help:
	- `hektor -h`

Example usage:
    - `hektor ilias_export.zip grady.json
