'''lccs.py - Waqas Bhatti (wbhatti@astro.princeton.edu) - Aug 2018
License: MIT - see LICENSE for the full text.

This contains functions to search for objects and get light curves from a Light
Curve Collection (LCC) server (https://github.com/waqasbhatti/lcc-server) using
its HTTP API.


SERVICES SUPPORTED
------------------

This currently supports the following LCC server functions:

- conesearch   -> use cone_search(lcc_server, center_ra, center_decl, ...)

- ftsquery     -> use fulltext_search(lcc_server, searchterm, ...)

- columnsearch -> use column_search(lcc_server, filters, ...)

- xmatch       -> use xmatch_search(lcc_server, file_to_upload, ...)

The functions above will download the data products (data table CSVs, light
curve ZIP files) of the search results automatically, or in case the query takes
too long, will return within a configurable timeout. The query information is
cached to ~/.astrobase/lccs, and can be used to download data products for
long-running queries later.

The functions below support various auxiliary LCC services:

- get-dataset  -> use get_dataset(lcc_server, dataset_id)

- objectinfo   -> use object_info(lcc_server, objectid, collection, ...)

- dataset-list -> use list_recent_datasets(lcc_server, nrecent=25, ...)

- collections  -> use list_lc_collections(lcc_server)

    '''This runs a cone-search query.

    Returns a tuple with the following elements:

    (search result status dict,
     search result CSV file path,
     search result LC ZIP path)

    lcc_server is the base URL of the LCC server to talk to.
    (e.g. for HAT, use: https://data.hatsurveys.org)

    center_ra, center_decl are the central coordinates of the search to
    conduct. These can be either decimal degrees of type float, or sexagesimal
    coordinates of type str:

    OK: 290.0, 45.0
    OK: 15:00:00 +45:00:00
    OK: 15 00 00.0 -45 00 00.0
    NOT OK: 290.0 +45:00:00
    NOT OK: 15:00:00 45.0

    radiusarcmin is the search radius. This is in arcminutes. The maximum radius
    you can use is 60 arcminutes.

    result_visibility is one of 'private', 'unlisted', 'public'.

    'private' -> the dataset and its products are not visible or accessible by
                 any user other than the one that created the dataset.

    'unlisted' -> the dataset and its products are not visible in the list of
                  public datasets, but can be accessed if the dataset URL is
                  known

    'public' -> the dataset and its products are visible in the list of public
                datasets and can be accessed by anyone.

    email_when_done is either True or False. If True, the LCC-Server will email
    you when the search is complete. This will also set download_data to
    False. Using this requires an LCC-Server account and an API key tied to that
    account.

    collections is a list of LC collections to search in. If this is None, all
    collections will be searched.

    columns is a list of columns to return in the results. Matching objects'
    object IDs, RAs, DECs, and links to light curve files will always be
    returned so there is no need to specify these columns.

    filters is an SQL-like string to use to filter on database columns in the
    LCC server's collections. To see the columns available for a search, visit
    the Collections tab in the LCC server's browser UI. The filter operators
    allowed are:

    lt      -> less than
    gt      -> greater than
    ge      -> greater than or equal to
    le      -> less than or equal to
    eq      -> equal to
    ne      -> not equal to
    ct      -> contains text
    isnull  -> column value is null
    notnull -> column value is not null

    You may use the 'and' and 'or' operators between filter specifications to
    chain them together logically.

    Example filter strings:

    "(propermotion gt 200.0) and (sdssr lt 11.0)"
    "(dered_jmag_kmag gt 2.0) and (aep_000_stetsonj gt 10.0)"
    "(gaia_status ct 'ok') and (propermotion gt 300.0)"
    "(simbad_best_objtype ct 'RR') and (dered_sdssu_sdssg lt 0.5)"

    sortspec is a tuple of two items:

    ('column to sort by', 'asc|desc')

    This sets the column to sort the results by. For cone_search, the default
    column and sort order are 'dist_arcsec' and 'asc', meaning the distance from
    the search center in ascending order.

    samplespec is an integer indicating how many rows from the initial search
    result to return as a uniform random sample.

    limitspec is an integer indicating how many rows from the initial search
    result to return in total.

    sortspec, samplespec, and limitspec are applied in this order:

    sample -> sort -> limit

    download_data sets if the accompanying data from the search results will be
    downloaded automatically. This includes the data table CSV, the dataset
    pickle file, and a light curve ZIP file. Note that if the search service
    indicates that your query is still in progress, this function will block
    until the light curve ZIP file becomes available. The maximum wait time in
    seconds is set by maxtimeout and the refresh interval is set by refresh.

    To avoid the wait block, set download_data to False and the function will
    write a pickle file to ~/.astrobase/lccs/query-[setid].pkl containing all
    the information necessary to retrieve these data files later when the query
    is done. To do so, call the retrieve_dataset_files with the path to this
    pickle file (it will be returned).

    outdir if not None, sets the output directory of the downloaded dataset
    files. If None, they will be downloaded to the current directory.

    lcc_server is the base URL of the LCC server to talk to.
    (e.g. for HAT, use: https://data.hatsurveys.org)

    searchterm is the term to look for in a full-text search of the LCC server's
    collections. This can be an object name, tag, description, etc., as noted in
    the LCC server's full-text search tab in its browser UI. To search for an
    exact match to a string (like an object name), you can add double quotes
    around the string, e.g. searchitem = '"exact match to me needed"'.

    result_visibility is one of 'private', 'unlisted', 'public'.

    'private' -> the dataset and its products are not visible or accessible by
                 any user other than the one that created the dataset.

    'unlisted' -> the dataset and its products are not visible in the list of
                  public datasets, but can be accessed if the dataset URL is
                  known

    'public' -> the dataset and its products are visible in the list of public
                datasets and can be accessed by anyone.

    email_when_done is either True or False. If True, the LCC-Server will email
    you when the search is complete. This will also set download_data to
    False. Using this requires an LCC-Server account and an API key tied to that
    account.

    collections is a list of LC collections to search in. If this is None, all
    collections will be searched.

    columns is a list of columns to return in the results. Matching objects'
    object IDs, RAs, DECs, and links to light curve files will always be
    returned so there is no need to specify these columns.

    filters is an SQL-like string to use to filter on database columns in the
    LCC server's collections. To see the columns available for a search, visit
    the Collections tab in the LCC server's browser UI. The filter operators
    allowed are:

    lt      -> less than
    gt      -> greater than
    ge      -> greater than or equal to
    le      -> less than or equal to
    eq      -> equal to
    ne      -> not equal to
    ct      -> contains text
    isnull  -> column value is null
    notnull -> column value is not null

    You may use the 'and' and 'or' operators between filter specifications to
    chain them together logically.

    Example filter strings:

    "(propermotion gt 200.0) and (sdssr lt 11.0)"
    "(dered_jmag_kmag gt 2.0) and (aep_000_stetsonj gt 10.0)"
    "(gaia_status ct 'ok') and (propermotion gt 300.0)"
    "(simbad_best_objtype ct 'RR') and (dered_sdssu_sdssg lt 0.5)"

    sortspec is a tuple of two items:

    ('column to sort by', 'asc|desc')

    This sets the column to sort the results by. For cone_search, the default
    column and sort order are 'dist_arcsec' and 'asc', meaning the distance from
    the search center in ascending order.

    samplespec is an integer indicating how many rows from the initial search
    result to return as a uniform random sample.

    limitspec is an integer indicating how many rows from the initial search
    result to return in total.

    sortspec, samplespec, and limitspec are applied in this order:

    sample -> sort -> limit

    download_data sets if the accompanying data from the search results will be
    downloaded automatically. This includes the data table CSV, the dataset
    pickle file, and a light curve ZIP file. Note that if the search service
    indicates that your query is still in progress, this function will block
    until the light curve ZIP file becomes available. The maximum wait time in
    seconds is set by maxtimeout and the refresh interval is set by refresh.

    To avoid the wait block, set download_data to False and the function will
    write a pickle file to ~/.astrobase/lccs/query-[setid].pkl containing all
    the information necessary to retrieve these data files later when the query
    is done. To do so, call the retrieve_dataset_files with the path to this
    pickle file (it will be returned).

    outdir if not None, sets the output directory of the downloaded dataset
    files. If None, they will be downloaded to the current directory.

    lcc_server is the base URL of the LCC server to talk to.
    (e.g. for HAT, use: https://data.hatsurveys.org)

    file_to_upload is a text file containing objectid, RA, declination rows for
    the objects to cross-match against the LCC server collections. This should
    follow the format of the following example:

    # example object and coordinate list
    # objectid ra dec

    # .
    # .
    # .
    # etc. lines starting with '#' will be ignored
    # (max 5000 objects)

    xmatch_dist_arcsec is the maximum distance in arcseconds to consider when
    cross-matching objects in the uploaded file to the LCC server's
    collections. The maximum allowed distance is 30 arcseconds. Multiple matches
    to an uploaded object are possible and will be returned in order of
    increasing distance.

    result_visibility is one of 'private', 'unlisted', 'public'.

    'private' -> the dataset and its products are not visible or accessible by
                 any user other than the one that created the dataset.

    'unlisted' -> the dataset and its products are not visible in the list of
                  public datasets, but can be accessed if the dataset URL is
                  known

    isnull  -> column value is null
    notnull -> column value is not null

    You may use the 'and' and 'or' operators between filter specifications to

    Example filter strings:

    "(simbad_best_objtype ct 'RR') and (dered_sdssu_sdssg lt 0.5)"

    sortspec is a tuple of two items:

    ('column to sort by', 'asc|desc')

    This sets the column to sort the results by. For cone_search, the default
    column and sort order are 'dist_arcsec' and 'asc', meaning the distance from
    the search center in ascending order.

    samplespec is an integer indicating how many rows from the initial search
    result to return as a uniform random sample.

    limitspec is an integer indicating how many rows from the initial search
    result to return in total.

    sortspec, samplespec, and limitspec are applied in this order:

    sample -> sort -> limit

    download_data sets if the accompanying data from the search results will be
    downloaded automatically. This includes the data table CSV, the dataset
    pickle file, and a light curve ZIP file. Note that if the search service
    indicates that your query is still in progress, this function will block
    until the light curve ZIP file becomes available. The maximum wait time in
    seconds is set by maxtimeout and the refresh interval is set by refresh.

    To avoid the wait block, set download_data to False and the function will

    '''This downloads a JSON form of the dataset from the specified lcc_server.

    This returns a dict from the parsed JSON. The interesting keys in the dict
    to look at are: 'coldesc' for the column descriptions and 'rows' for the
    actual data rows.

    lcc_server is the base URL of the LCC server to talk to.

    dataset_id is the unique setid of the dataset you want to get. In the
    results from the *_search functions above, this is the value of the
    infodict['result']['setid'] key in the first item (the infodict) in the
    returned tuple.

    strformat sets if you want the returned data rows to be formatted in their
    string representations already. This can be useful if you're piping the
    returned JSON straight into some sort of UI and you don't want to deal with
    formatting floats, etc. To do this manually when strformat is set to False,
    look at the 'coldesc' item in the returned dict, which gives the Python and
    Numpy string format specifiers for each column in the data table.

    If the dataset contains more than 1000 rows, it will be paginated, so you
    must use the page kwarg to get the page you want. The dataset JSON will
    contain the keys 'npages', 'currpage', and 'rows_per_page' to help with
    this.

    The JSON contains metadata about the query that produced the dataset,
    information about the data table's columns, and links to download the
    dataset's products including the light curve ZIP and the dataset CSV.

    '''This gets information on a single object from the LCC server.

    Returns a dict with all of the available information on an object, including
    finding charts, comments, object type and variability tags, and
    period-search results (if available).

    lcc_server is the base URL of the LCC server to talk to.

    objectid is the unique database ID of the object to retrieve info for. This
    is always returned as the `db_oid` column in LCC server search results.

    db_collection_id is the collection ID which will be searched for the
    object. This is always returned as the `collection` column in LCC server
    search results.

    NOTE: you can pass the result dict returned by this function directly into
    the astrobase.checkplot.checkplot_pickle_to_png function, e.g.:

    astrobase.checkplot.checkplot_pickle_to_png(result_dict,
                                                'object-%s-info.png' %
                                                result_dict['objectid'])

    to generate a quick PNG overview of the object information.


    Some important items in the result dict returned from this function:

    `objectinfo`: all object magnitude, color, GAIA cross-match, and object type
                  information available for this object

    `objectcomments`: comments on the object's variability if available

    `varinfo`: variability comments, variability features, type tags, period and
               epoch information if available

    `neighbors`: information on the neighboring objects of this object in its
                 parent light curve collection

    `xmatch`: information on any cross-matches to external catalogs (e.g. KIC,
              EPIC, TIC, APOGEE, etc.)

    `finderchart`: a base-64 encoded PNG image of the object's DSS2 RED finder
                   chart. To convert this to an actual PNG, try the function
                   astrobase.checkplot._b64_to_file.

    `magseries`: a base-64 encoded PNG image of the object's light curve. To
                 convert this to an actual PNG, try the function
                 astrobase.checkplot._b64_to_file.

    `pfmethods`: a list of period-finding methods applied to the object if
                 any. If this list is present, use the keys in it to get to the
                 actual period-finding results for each method. These will
                 contain base-64 encoded PNGs of the periodogram and phased
                 light curves using the best three peaks in the periodogram, as
                 well as period and epoch information.
