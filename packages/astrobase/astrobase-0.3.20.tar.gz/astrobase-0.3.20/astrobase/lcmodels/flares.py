def flare_model(flareparams, times, mags, errs):
    '''This is a flare model function, similar to Kowalski+ 2011.

    Model params
    ------------

    flareparams is a list:

    [amplitude, flare_peak_time, rise_gaussian_stdev, decay_time_constant]

    where:

    amplitude: the maximum flare amplitude in mags or flux. If flux, then
    amplitude should be positive. If mags, amplitude should be negative.

    flare_peak_time: time at which the flare maximum happens

    rise_gaussian_stdev: the stdev of the gaussian describing the rise of the
                         flare

    decay_time_constant: the time constant of the exponential fall of the flare


    Other args
    ----------

    times: a numpy array of times

    mags: a numpy array of magnitudes or fluxes. the flare will simply be added
    to mags at the appropriate times

    errs: a numpy array of measurement errors for each mag/flux measurement
