                epoch (time),
                pdepth (mags),
                pduration (phase),
                psdepthratio,
                secondaryphase]

    period is the period in days

    epoch is the time of minimum in JD

    pdepth is the depth of the primary eclipse
    - for magnitudes -> transitdepth should be < 0
    - for fluxes     -> transitdepth should be > 0

    pduration is the length of the primary eclipse in phase

    psdepthratio is the ratio in the eclipse depths:
    depth_secondary/depth_primary. This is generally the same as the ratio of
    the Teffs of the two stars.

    secondaryphase is the phase at which the minimum of the secondary eclipse is
    located. This effectively parameterizes eccentricity.

    All of these will then have fitted values after the fit is done.
