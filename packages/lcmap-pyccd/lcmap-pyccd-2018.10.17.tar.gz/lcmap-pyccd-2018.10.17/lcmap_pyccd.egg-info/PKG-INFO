Description:  Module specifically to hold algorithm version information.  The reason this
        exists is the version information is needed in both setup.py for install and
        also in ccd/__init__.py when generating results.  If these values were
        defined in ccd/__init__.py then install would fail because there are other
        dependencies imported in ccd/__init__.py that are not present until after
        install. Do not import anything into this module.
