The overall goal of Raster Vision is to make it easy to train and run machine learning models over imagery, including aerial and satellite imagery. It includes functionality for making training data, training models, making predictions, and evaluating models for the tasks of object detection (implemented via the Tensorflow Object Detection API), chip classificaiton (implemented via Keras), and semantic segmentation (implemented via Deep Lab).  It also supports running experimental workflows using AWS Batch. The library is designed to be easy to extend to new data sources, machine learning tasks, and machine learning implementation.

__Note: This README is out of date, and will be updated in the next week.__

The upcoming release will include:
* A flexible API for specifying experiments
* Generating many experiments and commands over hyperparameters
* Intelligent command running that will run commands only once if needed
* An audit trail for experiments that encourages repeatability
* Configurable model defaults that can be referenced from a key
* A plugin architecture that allows users to create their own Tasks, Backends and more.
* A QGIS Plugin:  https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision-qgis

Why do we need yet another deep learning library? In traditional object detection, each image is a small PNG file and contains a few objects. In contrast, when working with satellite and aerial imagery, each image is a set of very large GeoTIFF files and contains hundreds of objects that are sparsely distributed. In addition, annotations and predictions are represented in geospatial coordinates using GeoJSON files.

### Contact and Support

You can find more information and talk to developers (let us know what you're working on!) at:
* [Gitter](https://gitter.im/azavea/raster-vision)
* [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/raster-vision)

### Previous work on semantic segmentation and tagging

In the past, we developed prototypes for semantic segmentation and tagging in this repo, which were discussed in our [segmentation ](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2017/05/30/deep-learning-on-aerial-imagery/), and [tagging](https://www.azavea.com/blog/2018/01/03/amazon-deep-learning/) blog posts. This implementation has been removed from the `develop` branch and is unsupported, but can still be found at [this tag](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/releases/tag/old-semseg-tagging).
Similarly, an outdated prototype of object detection can be found at [this tag](https://github.com/azavea/raster-vision/releases/tag/old-object-detection) under the `rv` module.

### Docker images

Raster Vision is publishing docker images to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/azavea/raster-vision).
The tag for the `raster-vision` image determines what type of image it is:
- The `cpu-*` tags are for running the CPU containers.
- The `gpu-*` tags are for running the GPU containers.

We publish a new tag per merge into `develop`, which is tagged with the first 7 characters of the commit hash.
To use the latest version, pull the `latest` suffix, e.g. `raster-vision:gpu-latest`.
Git tags are also published, with the github tag name as the docker tag suffix.

### Contributing

We are happy to take contributions! It is best to get in touch with the maintainers
about larger features or design changes *before* starting the work,
as it will make the process of accepting changes smoother.

Everyone who contributes code to Raster Vision will be asked to sign the
Azavea CLA, which is based off of the Apache CLA.
