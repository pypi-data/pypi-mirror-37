        Introduction
        ============
        
        SENAITE.HEALTH is an Open Source Laboratory Information System (LIS) suitable
        for Health Care Laboratories, focused on patient and clinical cases.
        
        SENAITE.HEALTH is an extension for `SENAITE.CORE <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core>`_,
        an Open Source LIMS for enterprise environments, especially focused to behave
        with high speed, excellent performance and good stability.
        
        This software is a derivative work of BikaHealth_ software and comes with the same user 
        interface.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        SENAITE.HEALTH is built on top of `Plone CMS <https://plone.org>`_, so it must be
        installed first.
        Please, follow the `installation instructions for Plone 4.x <https://docs.plone.org/4/en/manage/installing/installation.html>`_
        first.
        
        Once Plone 4.x is installed successfully, you can choose any of the two options
        below:
        
        Ready-to-go installation
        ------------------------
        With this installation modality, the sources from ``senaite.health`` will be
        downloaded automatically from `Python Package Index (Pypi) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/senaite.health>`_.
        If you want the latest code from the `source code repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.health>`_,
        follow the `installation instructions for development <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.health/blob/master/README.rst#installation-for-development>`_.
        
        Create a new buildout file ``senaite.cfg`` which extends your existing
        ``buildout.cfg`` – this way you can easily keep development stuff separate from
        your main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server::
        
          [buildout]
          index = https://pypi.python.org/simple
          extends = buildout.cfg
        
          [instance]
          eggs +=
              senaite.health
        
        Note that with this approach you do not need to modify the existing buildout.cfg
        file.
        
        Then build it out with this special config file::
        
          bin/buildout -c senaite.cfg
        
        and buildout will automatically download and install all required dependencies.
        
        For further details about Buildout and how to install add-ons for Plone, please check
        `Installing add-on packages using Buildout from Plone documentation <https://docs.plone.org/4/en/manage/installing/installing_addons.html>`_.
        
        
        Installation for development
        ----------------------------
        
        This is the recommended approach how to enable ``senaite.health`` for your
        development environment. With this approach, you'll be able to download the
        latest source code from `senaite.health's repository <https://github.com/senaite/senaite.health>`_
        and contribute as well.
        
        Use git to fetch ``senaite.health`` source code to your buildout environment::
        
          cd src
          git clone git://github.com/senaite/senaite.health.git senaite.health
        
        Create a new buildout file ``senaite.cfg`` which extends your existing
        ``buildout.cfg`` – this way you can easily keep development stuff separate
        from your main buildout.cfg which you can also use on the production server.
        
        ``senaite.cfg``::
        
          [buildout]
          index = https://pypi.python.org/simple
          extends = buildout.cfg
          develop +=
              src/senaite.health
        
          [instance]
          eggs +=
              senaite.health
        
        Note that with this approach you do not need to modify the existing buildout.cfg
        file.
        
        Then build it out with this special config file::
        
          bin/buildout -c senaite.cfg
        
        and buildout will automatically download and install all required dependencies.
