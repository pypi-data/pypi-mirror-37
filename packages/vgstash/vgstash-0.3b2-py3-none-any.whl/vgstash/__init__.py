# Remixed vgstash. This time I chose an individual file on purpose:
#
# * Only need a single module to interface with a game DB. That's awesome.
# * Keeps the backend separate from the UI, as intended.
# * SQLA and pandas are both too large and unwieldy for my intent, and deps
#   will need to be kept low if I want to be cross-platform. sqlite3's part of
#   the standard library, can't beat that.
# * GUI will be implemented in tkinter, Qt, and/or Kivy.
