# vgstash - a place to stash your game collection

If you love video games, you've probably amassed a collection of them, across
many different systems; physical, digital, and everything in-between. At some
point, a player may want to know a few key pieces of information that may steer
their gaming. These questions are great for quelling boredom and keeping a
gaming backlog manageable:

* Which games do I own?
* Which games have I beaten or completed?
* Which games do I need to beat?
* What was the note I left for X game?

vgstash seeks to answer these type of questions in a simple and extensible way.

# Installation

vgstash is available via `pip`:

~~~
pip install [--user] vgstash
~~~

Packages for vgstash on Gentoo Linux and Ad√©lie Linux are on the TODO list.

Please note that vgstash is under heavy development at present. Do not install
unless you are interested in helping its development.

# Concept

The core concept of vgstash is the game itself. Every game in a player's
collection has a few important attributes, all of which are obvious to the
player:

* Title
* System
* Ownership
    * unowned
    * physical
    * digital
    * both
* Progress
    * new
    * playing
    * beaten
    * complete
* Notes

Think of any game that you have a history with. Let's say it was a game you
bought as part of a Humble Bundle, but haven't started playing yet. Internally,
vgstash tracks it somewhat like this:

```
.--------------------------------------------------------.
| Title                  | System | Ownership | Progress |
|------------------------+--------+-----------+----------|
| FTL: Faster Than Light | Steam  | digital   | new      |
'--------------------------------------------------------'
```

This is the bare minimum information you need to meaningfully track a video 
game in your collection.

vgstash comes with a command line client of the same name, which gives you
high level commands to manipulate the database with. It's the reference
implementation for a vgstash client.

If you wanted to add the above game to your collection, you'd do it like this:

```bash
$ vgstash add 'FTL: Faster Than Light' Steam d n
Added FTL: Faster Than Light for Steam. You digitally own it and you have not started it.
```

Pretty easy, huh? Each game and system added to vgstash is free-form and can
be tuned to match the user's preferences. vgstash has a fairly small set of
commands:

* add
* delete
* update
* list

The power is in the `list` command. vgstash comes with a set of default filters 
that allow you to reason about your game collection. For example, this command 
will show you every game marked "playing" that you also own in some way:

```bash
$ vgstash list playlog
# listed output here
```

Consult `vgstash -h` for further usage information.

# Roadmap

These are planned for the full 0.3 release:

* command line interface finished
* Match feature-set with `master`

Goals planned for the 0.4 release:

* import and export with JSON

Goals planned for the 0.5 release:

* some sort of GUI (Tk and Qt are current candidates)

Goals planned for the 1.0 release:

* Kivy-based interface (to release on Android via F-Droid)
