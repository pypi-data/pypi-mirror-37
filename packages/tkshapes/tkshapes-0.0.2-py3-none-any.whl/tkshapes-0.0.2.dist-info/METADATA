# Tkinter Canvas Shapes

The tkshapes module adds a GCanvas widget which can contain user-configurable shapes.
The GCanvas widget supports the standard Tk canvas shapes, as well as some others
useful in diagrams.

  * GObjects can be constructed from GItems
  * GObjects are displayed on the GCanvas
  * GObjects can be dragged around individually, or selected and dragged together
  * Panning on the GCanvas is bound to the Mousewheel
  * Zooming on the GCanvas is bound to Control-Mousewheel
  * Use Click-Drag to mark out a selection box to select multiple objects
  * Use Control-Click to toggle selection status on individual GObjects
