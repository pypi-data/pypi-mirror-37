======================

Pre-commit hook for Git checking Python code quality. The hook will check files ending with `.py` or that has a she bang (#!) containing `python`.

The script will try to find pylint configuration files in the order determined by pylint. It also looks for a [pre-commit-hook] section in the pylint configuration for commit hook specific options.

Installation
------------

Install via PyPI

    pip install git-pylint-commit-hook


Usage
------

The commit hook will automatically be called when you are running `git commit`. If you want to skip the tests for a certain commit, use the `-n` flag, `git commit -n`.

### Configuration

Settings are loaded by default from the .pylintrc file in the root of your repo.

    [pre-commit-hook]
    command=custom_pylint
    params=--rcfile=/path/to/another/pylint.rc
    limit=8.0

_command_ is for the actual command, for instance if pylint is not installed globally, but is in a virtualenv inside the project itself.

_params_ lets you pass custom parameters to pylint

_limit_ is the lowest value which you want to allow for a pylint score.  Any lower than this, and the script will fail and won't commit.

Any of these can be bypassed directly in the pre-commit hook itself.  You can also set a different default place to look for the pylintrc file.

Running tests
-------------

The test suite requires `nose2` to be installed. Install it with `pip install nose2`, then run the tests by executing the following command (in the project root folder):

    nose2

Requirements
------------

This project supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.5. Please install other requirements via

	pip install -r requirements.txt
