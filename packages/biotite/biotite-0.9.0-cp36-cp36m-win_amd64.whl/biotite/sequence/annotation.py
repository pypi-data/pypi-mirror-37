class Annotation(Copyable):
    """
    An `Annotation` is a list of features belonging to one sequence.
    
    Its advantage over a simple list is the base/residue position based
    indexing:
    When using slice indices in Annotation objects, a subannotation is
    created, containing copies of all `Feature` objects whose first and
    last base/residue are in range of the slice.
    If the slice starts after the first base/residue or/and the slice
    ends before the last residue, the position out of range is set to
    the boundaries of the slice (the `Feature` is truncated). In this
    case the `Feature` obtains the `MISS_LEFT` and/or `MISS_RIGHT`
    defect.
    The third case occurs when a `Feature` starts after the slice ends
    or a `Feature` ends before the slice starts. In this case the
    `Feature` will not appear in the subannotation.
    
    The start or stop position in the slice indices can be omitted, then
    the subannotation will include all features from the start or up to
    the stop, respectively. Step values are ignored.
    The stop values are still exclusive, i.e. the subannotation will
    contain a not truncated `Feature` only if its last base/residue is
    smaller than the stop value of the slice.
    
    Integers or other index types are not supported. If you want to
    obtain the `Feature` instances from the `Annotation` you need to 
    iterate over it. The iteration has no defined order.
    Alternatively, you can obtain a copy of the internal `Feature` list
    via `get_features()`.
    
    Multiple `Annotation` objects can be concatenated to one
    `Annotation` object using the '+' operator. Single `Feature`
    instances can be added this way, too. If a feature is present
    in both `Annotation` objects, the resulting `Annotation` will
    contain this feature twice.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    features : iterable object of Feature, optional
        The list of features to create the `Annotation` from. if not
        provided, an empty `Annotation` is created.
    
    Examples
    --------

class AnnotatedSequence(Copyable):
    """
    An `AnnotatedSequence` is a combination of a `Sequence` and an
    `Annotation`.
    
    Indexing an `AnnotatedSequence` with a slice returns another
    `AnnotatedSequence` with the corresponding subannotation and a
    sequence start corrected subsequence, i.e. indexing starts at 1 with
    the default sequence start 1. The sequence start in the newly
    created `AnnotatedSequence` is the start of the slice.
    Furthermore, integer indices are allowed in which case the
    corresponding symbol of the sequence is returned (also sequence
    start corrected).
    In both cases the index must be in range of the sequence, e.g. if
    sequence start is 1, index 0 is not allowed.
    Negative indices do not mean indexing from the end of the sequence,
    in contrast to the behavior in `Sequence` objects.
    Both index types can also be used to modify the sequence.
    
    Another option is indexing with a `Feature` (preferably from the
    `Annotation` in the same `AnnotatedSequence`). In this case a
    sequence, described by the location(s) of the `Feature`, is
    returned.
    When using a `Feature` for setting an `AnnotatedSequence` with a
    sequence, the new sequence is replacing the locations of the
    `Feature`. It is important to note that the sum of the location's 
    interval lengths must fit the length of the replacing sequence.
        
    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : Sequence
        The sequence. Usually a `NucelotideSequence` or
        `ProteinSequence`.
    annotation : Annotation
        The annotation corresponding to `sequence`.
    sequence_start : int, optional
        By default, the first symbol of the sequence is corresponding
        to location 1 of the features in the annotation. The location
        of the first symbol can be changed by setting this parameter.
        Negative values are not supported yet.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    sequence : Sequence
        The represented sequence.
    annotation : Annotation
        The annotation corresponding to `sequence`.
    sequence_start : int
        The location of the first symbol in the sequence.
