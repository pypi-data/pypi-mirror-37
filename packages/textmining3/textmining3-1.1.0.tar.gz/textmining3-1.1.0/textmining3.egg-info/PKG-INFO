        Features
        --------
        
        This package contains a variety of useful functions for text mining in Python 3.
        
        It focuses on statistical text mining (i.e. the bag-of-words model) and makes it
        very easy to create a term-document matrix from a collection of documents. This
        matrix can then be read into a statistical package (R, MATLAB, etc.) for further
        analysis. The package also provides some useful utilities for finding
        collocations (i.e. significant two-word phrases), computing the edit distance
        between words, and chunking long documents up into smaller pieces.
        
        The package has a large amount of curated data (stopwords, common names, an
        English dictionary with parts of speech and word frequencies) which allows the
        user to extract fairly sophisticated features from a document.
        
        This package does NOT have any natural language processing capabilities such as
        part-of-speech tagging. Please see the Python NLTK for that sort of
        functionality (plus much, much more).
        
        The original code and documentation is available in PyPI under the package name
        `textmining`. This package is a port to Python 3 and published in PyPI under the package
        name textmining3, and is based on the original.
