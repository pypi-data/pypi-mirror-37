<sup><sub>(Shields: Gotta Catch Em All)</sub></sup>

> A music downloader that understands your metadata needs.

A tool to download your music with metadata. It uses [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) for finding metadata and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) for the actual audio source. You will need to have some Spotify tokens, the instructions to set them up are [here](https://github.com/kepoorhampond/irs#spotify-tokens).

Works with Python 2 and 3.

## Install and Setup
```
$ sudo pip install irs
$ irs --setup
$ pip install youtube_dl # Only if on windows
```

**You will need to have some Spotify tokens, the instructions to set them up are [here](https://github.com/kepoorhampond/irs#spotify-tokens).**


## Demo and Usages

This is a demo of the CLI displayling its features:
[![demo](https://asciinema.org/a/105993.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/105993?autoplay=1)

The usages can be found with the `-h` or `--help` flag:
```
usage: irs [-h] [-a ARTIST -s SONG] [-A ALBUM [-a ARTIST]]
           [-u USERNAME -p PLAYLIST] [-l LOCATION] [-o] [-c]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ARTIST, --artist ARTIST
                        Specify artist name. Must be used with -s/--song or
                        -A/--album
  -s SONG, --song SONG  Specify song name. Must be used with -a/--artist
  -A ALBUM, --album ALBUM
                        Specify album name
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Specify username. Must be used with -p/--playlist
  -p PLAYLIST, --playlist PLAYLIST
                        Specify playlist name. Must be used with -u/--username
  -l LOCATION, --location LOCATION
                        Specify a directory to place files in.
  -o, --organize        Organize downloaded files.
  -c, --config          Display path to config file.
```

So all of these are valid commands:
```
$ irs -a "Brandon Flowers" -s "Lonely Town"
$ irs -u "spotify" -p "Brain Food"
$ irs -A "Suicide Squad: The Album"
```
But these are not:
```
$ irs -s "Bohemian Rhapsody"
$ irs -p "Best Nirvana"
```

## Spotify Tokens

To download metadata through spotify, you'll want to head to their Dev Apps page, [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/). After doing that you'll want to create a new app. Name it whatever you want and then once you've done that, find the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` keys. You'll want to take those keys and paste them into your system's environment variables as `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, correspondingly. Voil√†! You can now download metadata with IRS!

## Metadata

Currently, the program attaches the following metadata to the downloaded files:
 - Title
 - Artist
 - Album
 - Album Art
 - Genre
 - Track Number
 - Disc Number
 - Compilation (iTunes only)

## Philosophy

When I made this program I was pretty much broke and my music addiction wasn't really helping that problem. So, I did the obvious thing: make an uber-complicated program to ~~steal~~ download music for me! As for the name, its acronym spells IRS, which I found amusing, seeing as the IRS ~~takes~~ steals money while my program ~~gives~~ reimburses you with music.

The design/style inspiration of the CLI goes to [k4m4](https://github.com/k4m4).
