       And network "freenode" channel "#channel2" last message is "#13"
      When client comments "#13" on "freenode" channel "#channel2"

       And gitlabirced running
      When client comments "!22" on "gimpnet" channel "#channel3"
      Then network "gimpnet" channel "#channel3" contains "2" messages
       And network "gimpnet" channel "#channel3" last message is about merge request "22" project "bst/bst"

  Scenario: Send multiple merge request numbers to channel
     Given a gitlabirced watcher
