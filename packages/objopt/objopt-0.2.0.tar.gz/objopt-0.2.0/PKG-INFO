Description: 
        ## objopt
        This library provides object oriented optimization. This allows...
        
        1. using theoretic values (such as the strong convexity parameter)
        2. object-oriented definitions, both for models and optimization algorithms. This allows...
            * interacting with the optimization as an object. Want to compute some
              value partway through? Want to change the values as time goes on?
            * getting results intermediately (or in the presence of a keyboard
              interrept)
            * having callbacks, etc
        
        A typical example:
        
        ``` python
        def get_stats():
            # ...
        
        model = Model()
        opt = SGD(model.loss)
        
        data = []
        for _ in range(10):
            opt.step(steps=10)
            data += [get_stats(model)]
        ```
