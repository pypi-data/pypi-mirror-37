Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        An addon for Plone, which changes the deletion-behaviour.
        
        If a user deletes items, move them to a trashcan-folder named 'trash',
        living in the upper next available navigation-root-folder – which is usually
        the site-root-folder – instead of really deleting them.
        
        Items inside of 'trash'-folders, or trash-folder themselves, will still
        be actually, really, deleted.
        
        Missing trash-folders are created on the fly.
        
        Immediately after installation you won't see any trash-folders,
        go on, delete something, they'll appear.
        
        After an item has been trashed, its workflow-state is set to 'private',
        so its content is not unintentionally exposed to the public.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Add 'adi.trash' to the eggs-section of your buildout-config,
        run buildout, restart instance(s).
        
        Then go to the add-on-controlpanel of your site and activate this add-on.
