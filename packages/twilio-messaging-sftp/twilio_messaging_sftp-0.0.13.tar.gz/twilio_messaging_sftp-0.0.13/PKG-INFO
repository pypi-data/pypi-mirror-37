Description: # Messaging SFTP Helper Library
        > Sending 1 million messages? Upload a file with your messages to our FTP server and Twilio will take care of the REST. Note: Library only tested with Python3.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the package, invoke:
        ```shell
        python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ twilio-messaging-sftp
        ```
        
        
        This library provides a helper to send messages using CSV to many users at once.
        You should import it to your project if you choose to.
        
        The csv file should contain a `to`, `from`, `body`, we also support mms using `media_url`.
        If you want any other fields in the csv we will return them with the results.
        If your body needs a comma in it make sure that the text has `" "` around it.
        
        Once the csv is parsed, use `MessageClient` (requires Twilio Account Sid and Authorization Token) 
        to send messages for each parsed query.
