Life, the Universe, and Everything
==================================

Finger Pointing is a basic audit logger that helps you keep record of events like user login/logout and content types objects life cycle.
All events are logged into the standard Zope log and, optionally, to a dedicated audit log file.

Other features included:

- configurable via control panel configlet
- log entries can be easily visualized by users with permissions to do so
- support for Cloudflare's ``CF-Connecting-IP`` request header to log real client IP addresses
- support for automatic log rotation based on audit log file size

Don't Panic
===========

Installation
------------

To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:

Edit your buildout.cfg and add the following to it:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.fingerpointing

By default, Finger Pointing logs audit events to the Zope event log only.
To enable logging to a separate file use the following configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [instance]
    zope-conf-additional +=
        <product-config collective.fingerpointing>
            audit-log ${buildout:directory}/var/log/audit.log
            audit-log-max-size 10240
            audit-log-old-files 30
        </product-config>

audit-log
    The filename of the audit log. Add file name to create Finger Pointing audit file.
audit-log-max-size
    Maximum size of audit log file (in bytes). Adding this max size enables log rotation.
audit-log-old-files
    Number of previous log files to retain when log rotation is enabled. Defaults to 1.

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to Finger Pointing and click the 'Activate' button.

Usage
-----

Go to 'Site Setup' and select 'Finger Pointing' and enable the events you want to keep an eye on.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/collective.fingerpointing/master/docs/controlpanel.png

    :height: 600px
    :width: 768px

    The Finger Pointing control panel configlet.

Finger Pointing will start logging the selected events:

.. code-block:: console

    # bin/instance fg
    2016-09-26 15:23:36 INFO ZServer HTTP server started at Mon Sep 26 15:23:36 2016

    2016-09-26 15:24:28 INFO collective.fingerpointing user=admin ip=127.0.0.1 action=login

These events are also logged in `var/log/audit.log`:

.. code-block:: console

    2016-09-26 15:24:19,717 - INFO - user=admin ip=127.0.0.1 action=logout
    2016-09-26 15:24:28,415 - INFO - user=admin ip=127.0.0.1 action=login

An audit log view is available in the user menu to users with the `collective.fingerpointing: View Audit Log` permission:

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/collective.fingerpointing/master/docs/audit-log-view.png

    The Finger Pointing audit log view.

If you didn't specify a Finger Pointing audit log file name,  you'll see a warning.
However, audit events will be normally logged to the Zope event log:

.. code-block:: console

    # bin/instance fg
