This document is intended as a quick reference and showcase. For complete information on highlighter used please see the [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) implementation.

Take a look at the Markdown file to see how these are implemented.
{: .tip}

This is some **Python** code:

```python
def foo(bar):
    pass
```

This is some **JavaScript** code:

```javascript
function look(where) {
    if (where == 'here') {
        alert('woo');
    }
}
```

We can even highlight **markdown** code:

```markdown
# H1
I am **bold** and I am *italic*.
```


The [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor applies the syntax highlighting in the editor!
