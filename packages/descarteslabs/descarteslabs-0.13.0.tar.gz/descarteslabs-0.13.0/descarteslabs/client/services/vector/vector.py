    Client for storing and querying vector data.

    The Descartes Labs Vector service allows you store vector features (points, polygons, etc.)
    with associated key-value properties, and query that data by geometry or by properties.

    It works best at the scale of millions of features. For small amounts of vector data
    that easily fit in memory, working directly with a GeoJSON file or similar may be more efficient.

    Concepts:

    * "Feature": a single geometric entity and its associated metadata (equivalent to a GeoJSON Feature).
    * "Product": a collection of related Features, with a common name, description, and access controls.

    This client currently returns data as dictionaries in `JSON API format <http://jsonapi.org/>`_.
