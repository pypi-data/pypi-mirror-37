# RECURSIVELY REMOVE INVALID CHARS IN PATHS

A simple script to find and remove invalid characters in file and directory
names. Inspired by the need to workaround limitations of Egnyte ELC character
assignment.

The chars are currently hardcoded into the script, but like the list of servers
to run on, this should really be added to a config file.

There is a really convoluted bash version and a nice simple Python version and a
W.I.P Powershell version...

## INSTALLATION

`pip install rmchars`

## CLI USAGE

```
usage: rmchars [-h] (-i | -a | -t | -q | -f) [path]

Remove invalid characters from a given path.

positional arguments:
  path               a valid path

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -i, --interactive  prompt before renaming each path
  -a, --automate     rename each path without prompting
  -t, --dry_run      preform a dry run to see what would be renamed
  -q, --quiet        run silently
  -f, --find         print a list of invalid paths
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add char list to config file
- [ ] Finish Powershell version
