# RECURSIVELY REMOVE INVALID CHARS IN PATHS

A simple script to find and remove invalid characters in file and directory
names. Inspired by the need to workaround limitations of Egnyte ELC character
assignment.

The chars are currently hardcoded into the script, but like the list of servers
to run on, this should really be added to a config file.

There is a really convoluted bash version and a nice simple Python version and a
W.I.P Powershell version...

## INSTALLATION

`pip install treepick`

## CLI USAGE

```
```

## TODO

- [ ] ~~Add char list to config file~~
- [ ] ~~Finish Powershell version~~
