        # QuickNN
        
        The *quicknn* is a Tensorflow-based package that aims to simplify the application of the feedforward neural networks in classification and regression problems.
        The main features of the *quicknn* package are:
        
        * internally management of the categorical variables with one-hot-encoding(OHE) method batch-wise, just you have to feed it with pandas object;
        * internally management of the validation of the data while training;
        * possibility to stop the training phase, change some parameters and then resume the training from where it had remained;
        * allows easy visualization of the learning curves using [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard);
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        from quicknn import QuickNN
        from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
        from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
        
        X, y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)
        X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.25)
        
        qnn = QuickNN(list_neurons=[100, 200, 1])
        qnn.fit(X_train, y_train, n_epochs=10) ## In IPython session you can stop-change-resume the training.
        qnn.fit(X_train, y_train, n_epochs=20) ## Just increasing the n_epochs.
        qnn.fit(X_train, y_train, n_epochs=30,
                learning_rate=0.01) ## You can change e.g., the learning_rate param while training
        y_pred = qnn.predict(X_val)
        
        ```
        
        ## Installing
        The dependencies are showed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), which can be installed with the command:
        ```bash
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        Then the library can easily downloaded through pip:
        ```bash
        $ pip install quicknn
        ```
