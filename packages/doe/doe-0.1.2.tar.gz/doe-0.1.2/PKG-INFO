Description: # Design of Experiments and Analysis
        This python library gives you the power to do analysis of experiments easily and quickly.
        
        ## Getting Started
        ### Prerequisites
        ```
        Python 3.7
        ```
        ### Installing
        ```
        pip install doe
        ```
        ### How to use
        ```
        >>> import doe
        >>> model = doe.crd("data.csv")
        >>> model.print()
        ```
        And you are done.
