        *Automated LAN scanner based on masscan and nmap*
        
        
        `Gummy` is designed to automate routine tasks when scanning a local network.
        While :bear: is doing a boring job, you can do some really interesting work.
        Ultimately, all results are stored in the workspace directory.
        
        Installation
        ************
        Ideally, you should be able to just type:
        
            pip install gummy
        
        It is assumed that the paths to the programs in the configuration file are specified correctly, and the user is a root.
        If this is not the case, you need to set the SUID bits:
            
            $ which nmap
            /usr/bin/nmap
        
            $ sudo chmod +s /usr/bin/nmap
        
        
        Using
        *****
            $ gummy
            ...
            
            >>> set workspase test
            >>> set target 192.168.1.0/24
            >>> show config all
            >>> run 111_complex_1_2
            ...
            >>> show host
            ...
            >>> show port
