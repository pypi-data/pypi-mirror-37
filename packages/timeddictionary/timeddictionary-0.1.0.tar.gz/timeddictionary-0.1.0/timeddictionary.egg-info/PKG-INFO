Description: 
        A Python 3 module that provides a `TimedDict` class, which is designed to
        mimic the functionality of Redis's `EXPIRE`. Keys are
        set to expire after a certain number of seconds, and a callback function
        may optionally be called. Keys are continuously checked for expiration in
        a separate thread, so stale keys do not pile up in memory.
