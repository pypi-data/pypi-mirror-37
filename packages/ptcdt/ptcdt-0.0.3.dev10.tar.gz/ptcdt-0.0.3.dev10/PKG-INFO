        PTCDT is a simple tool to enable Thrift contract/consumer-driven testing. It enables one to spin up a Thrift server which mocks replies based on a JSON contract definition.
        
        Still under heavy development. Use it at your own risk. YMMV. If it doesn't work, fix it!
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Use pip:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install ptcdt
        
        then:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            ptcdt <CONFIG FILE>
        
        The config file should have everything the server needs to run. For sample configurations check https://github.com/vtatai/ptcdt/tree/master/tests/configs
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Install all development deps:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install -e .[dev]
        
        To run tests just call:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            export PYTHONTEST=src
            pytest
            pytest --pdb # Very handy
        
        I recomment using virtualenv + virtualenvwrapper for better env isolation. Also recommend iPython for command line.
