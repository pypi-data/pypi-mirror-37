Description: # Route Similarity
        
        Library of python methods to compute similarity between two routes described using lat, lon coordinates
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```sh
        pip install routesimilarity
        ```
        
        For development environments...
        
        ```sh
        git clone git@github.com:shkr/routesimilarity.git

        ### Todos
         - Only directed_hausdorff based on geodesic distance metric available now. Needs more similarity functions..
         - Add Example problems
