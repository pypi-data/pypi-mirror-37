About:
--
Visual timer is a simple terminal based timer that inspired by the principal of user-centric design. Unlike other timers, visual timer uses a spatial display of time that it allows you to have a peripheral awareness of the time. When you’re working on things that require higher-order thought, such as writing code, or thinking through a complex design process, you’re holding a lot of things in your head. Looking at the clock and doing base-60 subtraction will immediately snap you out of this thought process. Having a visual timer instance running in a window is a “big blob” that you can keep an eye on without having to divert your attention.

Usage:
--
* visual_timer [TIME]

Starts a countdown from the specified time. Must be in the format: HH:MM:SS

Installation:
--
pip install visual_timer

There's plenty of things that need to be done. Check out the issues on github.

Disclaimer:

Visual timer is super early stage. Don't call me a stooge when you realise the runtime is O(n^2), or that the timer drifts at higher resolutions/time settings.
