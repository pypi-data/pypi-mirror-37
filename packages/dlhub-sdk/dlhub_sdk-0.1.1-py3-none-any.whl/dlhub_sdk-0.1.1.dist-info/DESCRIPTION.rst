DLHub SDK contains utilities that simplify interacting with the Data and Learning Hub for Science (DLHub). This package contains tools for formatting descriptions of datasets and machine learning models in the format required by DLHub (MetadataModels), and a wrapper around the  REST API for DLHub (DLHubClient). The DLHubClient provides an easy route for publishing, discovering, and using machine learning models in DLHub.
