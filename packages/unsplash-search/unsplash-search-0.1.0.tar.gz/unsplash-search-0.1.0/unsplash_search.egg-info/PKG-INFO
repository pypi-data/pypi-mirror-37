Description: # unsplash-search
        
        Unsplash-search is small python library to search for photos from the Unsplash photograph hosting website.
        
        # Install
        
            pip install unsplash-search
        
        
        # Usage
        
        First and foremost, you must get an access key from the Unsplash Deverloper API website.
        
        You must then instantiate the UnsplashSearch Class with your key to use the program.
        
            unsplash = UnsplashSearch(YOUR_KEY)
        
        ## Search using queries
        The unsplash search method takes in a query as an argument for what kind of photos you
        want to get.
        
        If successful, it will return a random image dictionary.
        
            img = unsplash.search('mountains') #=> dict
        
        The image dictionary object has two keys: The url of the image, and the author's instagram username.
        
        So if you simply want to get a random image matching the query just do
        
            img['img']
