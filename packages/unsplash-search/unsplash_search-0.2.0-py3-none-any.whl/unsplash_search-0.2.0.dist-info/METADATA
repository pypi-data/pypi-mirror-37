# unsplash-search

Unsplash-search is small python library to search for photos from the Unsplash photograph hosting website.

# Install

    pip install unsplash-search


# Usage
Import the UnsplashSearch module

    from unsplash_search import UnsplashSearch

You must get an access key from the Unsplash Deverloper API website.

You must then instantiate the UnsplashSearch Class with your key to use the program.

    unsplash = UnsplashSearch(YOUR_KEY)

## Search using queries
The unsplash search method takes in a query as an argument for what kind of photos you
want to get.

If successful, it will return a random image dictionary.

    img = unsplash.search('mountains') #=> dict

The image dictionary object has two keys: The url of the image, and the author's instagram username.

So if you simply want to get a random image matching the query just do

    img['img']
