        pyTenable is a library designed to provide a simple & easy-to-understand library into the Tenable product APIs.  Currently the library is under active development and new componentry is being added & changed to fit the evolving needs, requirements, and desires for the end-goal of the library.
        
        **WARNING:** Currently in an alpha state and may change over time.
        
        **NOTE:** As of v0.2, paths for the sub-packages have changed slightly.  This was done to improve readability as lengthy imports are always a pain.
