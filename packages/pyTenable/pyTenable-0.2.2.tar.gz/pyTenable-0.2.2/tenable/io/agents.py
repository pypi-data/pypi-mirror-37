    '''
    The agents iterator provides a scalable way to work through agent result
    sets of any size.  The iterator will walk through each page of data,
    returning one record at a time.  If it reaches the end of a page of
    records, then it will request the next page of information and then continue
    to return records from the next page (and the next, and the next) until the
    counter reaches the total number of records that the API has reported.

    Attributes:
        count (int): The current number of records that have been returned
        page (list): 
            The current page of data being walked through.  pages will be
            cycled through as the iterator requests more information from the
            API.
        page_count (int): The number of record returned from the current page.
        total (int): 
            The total number of records that exist for the current request.

        Args:
            *filters (tuple, optional):
                Filters are tuples in the form of ('NAME', 'OPERATOR', 'VALUE').
                Multiple filters can be used and will filter down the data being
                returned from the API.

                Examples:
                    - ``('distro', 'match', 'win')``
                    - ``('name', 'nmatch', 'home')``

                As the filters mat change and sortable fields mat change over
                time, it's highly recommended that you look at the output of
                the `filters:agents-filters <https://cloud.tenable.com/api#/resources/filters/agents-filters>`_
                endpoint to get more details.
            filter_type (str, optional):
                The filter_type operator determines how the filters are combined
                together.  ``and`` will inform the API that all of the filter
                conditions must be met for an agent to be returned, whereas 
                ``or`` would mean that if any of the conditions are met, the
                agent record will be returned.
            limit (int, optional):
                The number of records to retrieve.  Default is 50
            offset (int, optional):
                The starting record to retrieve.  Default is 0.
            scanner_id (int, optional):
                The identifier the scanner that the agent communicates to.
            sort (tuple, optional):
                A tuple of tuples identifying the the field and sort order of
                the field.
            wildcard (str, optional):
                A string to pattern match against all available fields returned.
            wildcard_fields (list, optional):
                A list of fields to optionally restrict the wildcard matching
                to.
