Basic RDKit based Python tools for analysis of protein-ligand interactions.

Currently contains two things.

1. Clustering - based on WONKA method - but sepearated from that code-base. Cluster waters, residues, ligands and pharmacophores. (Under development).

2. Astex Fragment Network - implementation on the basis of their recent paper
