class TimeFixedGFormula:
    '''Time-fixed implementation of the g-formula, also referred to as the g-computation
    algorithm formula. This implementation has three options for the treatment courses:

    Key options for treatments
        all     -all individuals are given treatment
        none    -no individuals are given treatment
    Custom treatment
                -create a custom treatment. When specifying this, the dataframe must be
                 referred to as 'g' The following is an example that selects those whose
                 age is 30 or younger and are females
                 ex) treatment="((g['age0']<=30) & (g['male']==0))

    Currently, only supports binary or continuous outcomes. For binary outcomes a logistic regression
    model to predict probabilities of outcomes via statsmodels. For continuous outcomes a linear regression
    model is used to predict outcomes.
    Binary and multivariate exposures are supported. For binary exposures, a string object of the column name for
    the exposure of interest should be provided. For multivariate exposures, a list of string objects corresponding
    to disjoint indicator terms for the exposure should be provided. Multivariate exposures require the user to
    custom specify treatments when fitting the g-formula. A list of the custom treatment must be provided and be
    the same length as the number of disjoint indicator columns.

    See Snowden et al. (2011) for a good description of the time-fixed g-formula (also freely available on
    PubMed). See http://zepid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ for an example (highly recommended)
