Description: # leanpub cli
        
        Build leanpub books locally from the command line.

        This implements a simple cli for building ebooks locally. Rather than having
        upload your new change-set to Dropbox and then trigger leanpub build on
        their site - do it all locally.
        
        ## Usage
        
        To build the Book (this requires a `Book.txt`):
        
        ```sh
        $ leanpub book
        ```
        
        To build the Sample (this requires a `Sample.txt`):
        
        ```sh
        $ leanpub sample
        ```
        
        To build both:
        
        ```sh
        $ leanpub all
        ```
        
        You can also "watch" for changes in any of the markdown files you are using to
        build the book i.e. when a markdown file is saved:
        
        ```sh
        $ leanpub watch
        ```
        
        You can get help via the command line with:
        
        ```sh
        $ leanpub --help
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html):
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install leanpub
        ```
        
        *Note: if you don't have python installed I recommend
        [miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html); no-admin access required.*
        
        This requires that pandoc is installed, if it's not install it
        [here](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).
        
        ## Issues / troubleshooting / requests
        
        Please post an [issue on github](https://github.com/hayd/leanpub).
        
        ### Going forward
        
        I would like to improve the output to better match leanpub.
        Any help it that direction (e.g. css, or prepending the title page) would be
        great!
