Description: # Pymbdata
        
        A toy library that includes some complex data types seen in mathematics, engineering and statistics.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Numpy is used in the matrix, but it will be automatically installed when you install pymbdata.
        
        ### Installing
        
        To install the library you need to have PIP installed
        
        Installing the library
        
        ```
        pip install pymbdata
        ```
        
        To import it in a python script
        
        ```
        import pymb
        ```
        
        End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
