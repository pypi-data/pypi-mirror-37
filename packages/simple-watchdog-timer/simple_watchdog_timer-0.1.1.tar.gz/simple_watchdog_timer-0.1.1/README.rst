Backwards compatibility
-----------------------

Backwards compatibility is only guaranteed between minor versions above the stable version (1.0)
Therefore it's advised to to pin the module on a version ether the specific version like:
simple_watchdog_timer==X.X.X

or get the latest minor version:
simple_watchdog_timer~=X.X.X

Example
-------

The following example showcases the usage

.. code:: python

    import simple_watchdog_timer as swt
    from random import uniform
    from time import sleep


    def cb(dog):
        # When the callback gets triggered, it's good practice to pause the WDT to prevent it firing again, while you are handling the action required when it triggers
        dog.pause()

        # Do something when the WDT triggers...
        print('WDT Triggered')

        # Update / reset the internal WDT timer (dog.reset() does the same), this is important to avoid the time spent in the callback to influence the next triggering
        dog.update()

        # Resume the WDT
        dog.resume()

        # ...or:

        # If you would like to completely stop the WDT
        # dog.stop()

        # But you regret and want to start it again
        # dog.start()

        # Tip: stop() and start() can also be used instead of the more manual pause, update and resume if that is preferred (more simple, but less in-line expressive)


    def main():
        wdt = swt.WDT(check_interval_sec=0.01, trigger_delta_sec=0.50, callback=cb)

        while True:
            zzz_sec = uniform(0, 0.60)
            print('Sleep for {}'.format(zzz_sec))
            sleep(zzz_sec)

            wdt.update()


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

This example will print:

.. code:: python
