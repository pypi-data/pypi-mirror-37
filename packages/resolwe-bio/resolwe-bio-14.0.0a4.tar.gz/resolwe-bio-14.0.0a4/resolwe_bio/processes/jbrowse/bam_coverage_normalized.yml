        Used for reporting coverage normalized to 1x sequencing depth (also known as Reads Per Genomic Content (RPGC)). Sequencing depth is defined as: (total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size. The effective genome size is the portion of the genome that is mappable. Large fractions of the genome are stretches of NNNN that should be discarded. Also, if repetitive regions were not included in the mapping of reads, the effective genome size needs to be adjusted accordingly. Common values are: mouse/mm9: 2150570000, human/hg19:2451960000, D.melanogaster/dm3:121400000 and C.elegans/ce10:93260000.

      type: basic:boolean
      default: false
      description: >
        This parameter allows the extension of reads to fragment size. If set, each read is extended, without exception. *NOTE*: This feature is generally NOT recommended for spliced-read data, such as RNA-seq, as it would extend reads over skipped regions. *Single-end*: Requires a user specified value for the final fragment length. Reads that already exceed this fragment length will not be extended. *Paired-end*: Reads with mates are always extended to match the fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated reads, mate reads that map too far apart (>4x fragment length) or even map to different chromosomes are treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment length value is optional. If no value is specified, it is estimated from the data (mean of the fragment size of all mate reads).
