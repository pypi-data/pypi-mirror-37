Description: # make-songbook
        
        > make-songbook builds a ePub to bring your songs and tablatures into an eInk reader
        
        Your library has to be structured by artist and by song.
        
        Example:
        
        ```plain
        .
        ├── Mark Lanegan
        │   ├── The Cherry tree Carol.txt
        └── The Rolling Stones
            ├── Brown Sugar.txt
            └── Sympathy for the Devil.txt
        ```
        
        Running `make-songbook` will produce a single ePub containing all songs in that folder including a table of contents.
        
        Example:
        
        ```bash
        make-songbook MyLibrary
        ```
        
        The songbook will be located at the root of your song library (inside `MyLibrary` for the given example).
        
        > For simplicity reasons, only ePub format is currently supported. There is no plan to support any other format for now.
        > If you need to use another format, you may use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) that is able to convert your ePub
        > to many other formats (mobi, azw3 or even PDF).
