Description: parsemon2
        =========
        
        This is yet another attempt to bring monadic parsing to python.  The
        problem the author saw with many other implementations is a limit to
        their composability.  A lot of the times these otherwise quite well
        written implementations suffer pretty bad from pythons lack of TCO.
        This implementation uses trampolines to get around that.
        
        Right now this implementation is nothing more but a toy, but the tests
        that come with this package show already that it's parsing ability is
        not dependent on pythons recursion limit.
        
        We also have error messages.
