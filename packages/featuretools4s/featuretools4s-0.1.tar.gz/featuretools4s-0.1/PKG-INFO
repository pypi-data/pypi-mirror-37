Description: ## FeatureTools for Spark (featuretools4s)
        
        ### 1. What's FeatureTools? 
        FeatureTools is a Python library open-sourced by MIT's 
        FeatureLab aiming to automate 
        the process of feature engineering in Machine Learning 
        applications. 
        
        Please visit the [official website](https://docs.featuretools.com/index.html)
        for more details about FeatureTools. 
        
        *FeatureTools4S* is a Python library written by me aiming to scale 
        FeatureTools with **Spark**, making it capable of generating 
        features for billions of rows of data, which is usually 
        considered impossible to process on single machine using 
        original FeatureTools library with Pandas. 
        
        *FeatureTools4S* provides **almost the same** API as original 
        FeatureTools, which make its users completely free of transferring 
        between FeatureTools and FeatureTools4S. **Hence we suggest the readers 
        first to learn FeatureTools and then you can easily work on FeatureTools4S.**
