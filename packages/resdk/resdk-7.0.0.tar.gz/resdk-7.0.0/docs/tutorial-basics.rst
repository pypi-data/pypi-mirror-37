Genialis platform basics
========================

This chapter provides a general overview and explains the basic concepts.
We highly recommend reading it even though it is a bit theoretic.

Genialis platform and ReSDK
===========================

`Genialis platform`_ is a web application that can handle large quantities of
biological data, perform complex data analysis, organize results, and
automatically document your work in a reproducible fashion. It is based on
`Resolwe`_ and `Resolwe Bioinformatics`_. Resolwe is an open source dataflow
package for the `Django framework`_ while  Resolwe Bioinformatics is an
extension of Resolwe that provides bioinformatics pipelines.

Resolwe SDK for Python allows you to access Genialis platform through Python.
It supports accessing, modifying, uploading, downloading and organizing the
data.

Genialis platform runs on servers with strong computational capabilities. On
the contrary, ``resdk`` is a Python package on a local computer that interacts
with Genialis platform through a RESTful API. The power of ``resdk`` is its
lightweight character. It is installed with one simple command, but supports
manipulation of large data sets and heavy computation on a remote computer
cluster.

Data and Process
================

The two most fundamental resources in Genialis platform are
:obj:`Data<resdk.resources.Data>` and :obj:`Process<resdk.resources.Process>`.

**Process** stores an algorithm that transforms inputs into outputs. It is a
blueprint for one step in the analysis.

**Data** is an instance of a Process. It is a complete record of the performed
processing. It remembers the inputs (files, arguments, parameters...), the
algorithm used and the outputs (files, images, numbers...). In addition, Data
objects store some useful meta data, making it easy to reproduce the dataflow
and access information.

**Example use case:** you have a file ``reads.fastq`` with NGS read sequences
and want to map them to the genome ``genome.fasta`` with aligner ``STAR``.
Reads are one Data object and genome is another one. Alignment is done by
creating a third Data. At the creation, one always needs to define the Process
(``STAR``) and inputs (first and second Data). When the Data object is created,
the platform automatically runs the given process with provided inputs and
computes all inputs, outputs, and meta data.

Samples and Collections
=======================

Eventually, you will have many Data objects and want to organize them. Genialis
Platform includes different structures to help you group Data objects:
:obj:`Sample<resdk.resources.Sample>` and
:obj:`Collection<resdk.resources.Collection>`.

**Sample** represents a biological entity. It includes user annotations and
Data objects associated with this biological entity. In practice, all Data
objects in the Sample are derived from an initial single Data object.
Typically, a Sample would contain the following Data: raw reads, preprocessed
reads, alignment (bam file), and expressions. A Data object can belong to only
one Sample. Two distinct Samples cannot contain the same Data object.

**Collection** is a group of Samples. In addition to Samples and their Data,
Collections may contain Data objects that store other analysis results. Example
of this are differential expressions - they are done as combination of many
Samples and cannot belong to only one Sample. Samples and Data objects may be
in multiple Collections.

   Relations between Data, Samples and Collection. Samples
   are groups of Data objects originating from the same biological
   sample: all Data objects in a Sample are derived from a single NGS
   reads file. Collections are arbitrary groups of Samples
   and Data objects that store analysis results.

When a new Data object that represents a biological sample (*i.e.* fastq files,
bam files) is uploaded, the unannotated Sample is automatically created. It is
the duty of the researcher to properly annotate the Sample. When a Data object
that belongs to an existing Sample is used as an input to trigger a new
analysis, the output of this process is automatically attached to an existing
Sample.
