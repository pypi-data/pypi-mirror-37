        Command line usage
        ------------------

            speed_shoot -f csv -g /usr/local/data/geoIP /var/www/apache/access*log

        Well I guess, it does not work because you first need to fetch geoIP data file::
        
            mkdir data
            wget -O- "http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/GeoIP.dat.gz" | zcat > data/GeoIP.dat
        
        Of course, this is the geoLite database, I don't include the data in the package
        since geoIP must be updated often to stay accurate. 
        
        Default path for geoIP is data/GeoIP.dat
        
        Use as a script

        Installation
        ============
        
        easy as::
            
            pip install yahi
        
        or::
            
            easy_install yahi
        
        Recommanded usage
        =================
        
        - for basic log aggregation, I do recommand using command line;
        - for one shot metrics I recommend an interactive console (bpython or ipython);
        - for specific metrics or elaborate filters I recommand using the API. 
        
        CHANGELOG
