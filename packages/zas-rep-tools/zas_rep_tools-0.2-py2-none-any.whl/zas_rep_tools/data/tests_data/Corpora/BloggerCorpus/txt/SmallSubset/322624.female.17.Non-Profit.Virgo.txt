I wanna know...........Cuz when you put peanuts in a baggie and crunch them up, then eat them, it's ALMOST the same thing................. I wonder...................

      My parents left me alone for 2 hours and insanity took over. First I washed my hair...with Herbal Essense. I started yelling "Where are my Elf guys?! Come to me pretty guys! Come and wash my hair!" ...no one came... \/ \/ Then I went outside and was walking on top the snow. I was like "O! Look at me! I'm an elf! Walking on the snow! I'm a beast! ...geez I sound like Destinie. Okay, going back to being kim!" Then I fell into a hole and snow went up my pant legs >

      gah, sorry guys I got backed up >  Dest's dream: Well at least I'm noticed missing. you see me and Bakura were uh.."cleaning" the supply closet for Mrs. Swann...yeah *cough* -^ ^-  Yami: Yami or Yugioh is a thousand years old pharoh from Eygpt. Back then, they used magic to have battles with monsters as fun. the loser lost his life (thats always fun). but then the monsters started to get out of hand because of a magical demention called the shadow relem. here, the monsters actually came to life. to seal way the shadow relem, yugioh trapped himself and others into 7 "melenium objects". Now, several people have possion of these objects. when yugi needs help with the duel monster cards, yugioh takes control of his body.He's called yami because its the jap. name for dark. Yami also calls yugi hikari (light) or aibou (companion). so basically, Yami isa spirit thats takes control of Yugi in times of danger.  Janine: Hun, you are in the reality bound comic but you are not part of the crew. The Group is the basic cast and crew. Answer this: Do you sit at the third table in the CCSA caf. at lunch time, at 11:10 everyday? No? Then you arn't in the crew.  Piccy of Janine: Very nicly drawn Dest! You keep getting better at drawing anime us :) wee.just in case anyone is wondering where i am, i had a doc. appointment. he still isn't too sure about me going to school >

      O_O;;; Okay, Yugioh is a schizo so when his little magical thing errupts, this big tall guy with the same hairdo appears and his name is "Yami" or something like that. His voice gets deeper too, it's weird. Omg, I was playing the Two Towers video game and the actors do the character's voices. (he he he) Oh yeah, and Janine is always like, "where's me? I wanna be in the RBcrew picture" and I'm like, "You're not in the crew. The crew is the group" and she doesn't get it!! GRRRR! What is her problem! Someone explain it to her! I will draw her tribute and post it here but she needs to realize she is not in the GROUP!!  Hey David, did you finish the quiz yet? :)

      I am so bored. I want school. >D I had this weird dream...   So I was walking down a dark alleyway at about four in the morning. I was walking along side of Joey and Yugi was to his right. I was dressed in a robe, laced with gold with a bunch of gold chains and cloth underneath. Joey, was clad all in black with the same. Yugi, was well, Yami. Three people blocked our way up ahead and I couldn't make them out until the moon shined down on them and I noticed it was Yami Bakura, Marik, and some guy in a turban. Marik, who looked very mad, said something that I could not understand and a big moster appeared. It was Obelisk the Tormentor or something like that. Yugi's pyramid began to glow and the monster was all sucked up. Then, Marik, Looking even more pissed off, sent out a big, golden gryphon thing. I wipped out some Jackie Chan, Tossing aside the robe and sid some flips and stuff. Then I swung this big, gold staff that I had and the gryphon got sucked up. I smiled. Then Marik was really really really mad and he sent out an invisible moster that began to chase me. I was scared. I ran to a corner then Joey kicked a paint can full of blue paint. I then saw the feet that looked like elephant feet and then I swung my staff and electricity ran out. Then, a big bolt of lightning shot down from the sky and killed the monster. I looked around the corner and the police were coming! So I ran and was like, "The police! The police!" The two other people ran away but Bakura was like, "Quick! Follow me!" So we climbed up on a roof and flattened ourselves out and laid there. Then one of the officer's looked up and was like, "I see you, come down" (Meanwhile, two kids were running around screaming, 'Yo Trabajo! I'll get you!') "We're not the bad guys." I told him. "I know." We all began to walk away when Bakura was like, "Come here, look" And pointed to our staffs. (Joey's red, Mine gold; we had left them up there) And he said, "I could take them if you'd like." I gave him a sideways glance and uttered, "Noooo." We worked our way to school. When I finally got to school, the teachers were lined up at the doors talking about the "electric storm" so I stopped by my spanish teacher and asked her about if she saw the electric storm. She said, "No, I was taking care of my ferret." So Joey decided to run off (meanwhile, I'm still holding his staff in a plastic shoprite bag.) I went to look for him, when someone told me we had a half day. I seriously needed to look now, so I went into the cafeteria and called for him, he didn't come. Sighing, I walked away to board the bus. The bus was driving away when I ran and jumped into the bus (still holding the staffs) and I began to fall asleep because I was tired. I had spanish homework in my lap and the kid was like, "Hey! Don't stare, look, you're doing your spanish work wrong! That is nosotronamos!" I glared and thought, no way that is nosotrosamos! Outside, someone was flagging me down going, "I FOUND JOEY!" I jumped out of the bus and ran into the school where I saw David and Assia. "Hey!" David cried. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked them. "No." They said. "How about kim?" "No." They said. Sighing, I noticed that the bus was leaving. I asked TK if I could use his cellphone so he handed me a yellow remote. "You have to press this, this, this this this and this, to get it to go. Then you press the number and then press this, this this and this!" I put in the number but it was wrong. I tried to press the buttons in sequence to get it to work, but I did it wrong. Then I remembered that Joey and I were going to WALK home so I didn't need to worry. (Though my school is 40 mins away from my house) Then, while I was walking down the hallway, I saw Yami Yugi. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked. "I looked in the cafeteria, he wasn't there." Yugi said he didn't and I was sad and then...   I woke up. >.

      O_O; Thanks. Did you guys notice I'm adding the gallery here? Blahh!  Kim, I redid your picture (by the way, I loved it, it was so cute) I colored and I couldn't fit everyone on there, I draw too big. GNOMIE'S A PIMPIN' CAT!! Woo! The first thing janine said to me was, "Where's me?!?!" I had to explain she's not in the "group". *sigh* 'tis what you get once you add a minor character, don't you agree??  I can't think of any random quotes... ah! Wahh! Now, I am off to work on the website. Mangos... and cheese! (omg- wait! Kim, I am doing the "Origin of T-K-OH, with squirrels!" I need a better script idea...) Here's my quote then...  Tk: Once I finish the puzzle, You will all obey my fists of Iron... and cheese!!!  Tk: (again- firedrill day) Leggo my fuego!

And Pippin dies! j/k He almost does. Everyone thought he was but he didn't. SO everyone lived happily ever after. >

       The Vocal Thing: You know how Mrs. Eldreth gave us points on the board for singing loud and stuff or were you not there those two days?  Yugi: yeah, me and Dest went on a rampage, but you have to admit the psychopaths are really cute ^ ^  Quiz: I was bored and taking random tests and I took the RB test again, and I was David...  Rave: Raves are Nice... ~ ^  Thursday Lunch: We were all really bored and were pretending to be the power rangers. Then Mouse complained that she's always a cat thing in stuff and was going to make a Mouse Zoid. So there's your explaination. Guess What?! I forgot to enter this today, it's my Dad's B-Day so bow down to him...at least say happy birthday ^ ^ HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD!

MWA HA HA HA HA HA!!! "you have a lava lamp, i have a bucket." "most people would be happy meeting themselves once, i get to meet myself twice!" "Welcome to the TK army, and remember, it's not the size of your heart, it's the size of my paycheck. NOW GIVE ME A DOLLAR!" hehehe, you'll have to ask kim for explanation...

               Ok, this blog, well, I won't go in detail. Is starting to annoy me, well, theres a few things any way. So, after reading everything in the past few days I guess, I'm like ok..... I'm not takeing that stupid Yugi test, Yugi is highly starting to annoy me. I mean its reach its level of "I don't give a shit" I don't want to hear it...... but the yugi stuff isn't what annoys me, alought it did peve me a lil on the page to scroll down and see 5 huge pics. I dunno. Any way. I like your song kim yay fer you.  yeah des. we had a theme song apointed by you but, does that song really fit, I dunno I remember thinking it didn't..... So yay, for all the quizs, bah to Des, Wha? to Kim cuz I still dunn understand the vocal thing, or the edit thing, pha to the Yugi shit TAKEING OVE MY SCREEN, Like the FACE TAKEING OVER AMERICA!    Oh an      The quiz lies....  and I think its all from perspetive but I think gnome should at least be in it...... She deserves as much as Assia.....

      I ment on Blogger.... any way...  This is a very very very Funny story about me and Tais adventure to get money from Gnome so she can get to the prom. First the back story. We set it up last night, that after school I would drive up to the UofD to get the money, we planned on being there around 4.... that didn turn out so well. I wanted Tai to be with me... In case soemthing went wrong.... and Boi, Heh Heh, Did they!  Now I don't Feel like telling this story again as I am tired of wrong, So I'll post me and Gnoems IM's from when I told her....Feel free to correct spelling, and shit.   So I Called this a Reality Bound Ep. Called "Gnome Money Pick Up"     QuyteDragonSlaya:  me and Tai went down there..... we got there real late though, around 10     QuyteDragonSlaya:  then I forgot the directions cuz I was rushed to leave     RavNic1:  down where, down newark?   QuyteDragonSlaya:  and... we went to the trabant center... and looked around there.. and we were really stressed and pressed for time and all this shit was goin in my head   RavNic1:  awww     QuyteDragonSlaya:  Well,  I forgot the turn left at trabant, and turned right     RavNic1:  you were supposed to turn right     QuyteDragonSlaya:  cuz I had to have the car back at 5, and kinda kinnaped Tai who had to be home at 5:30... and it was like omg     RavNic1:  there was a parking lot on your right as you took the turn     QuyteDragonSlaya:  yeah, I found that out when I got home, read the directs. and was like... SHIT     RavNic1:  awww     RavNic1:  it's ok, we will figure this out   QuyteDragonSlaya:  yeah, but hmmm we'll come up with something.... first a story    QuyteDragonSlaya:  haha cuz when we were up there, we did some funny ass shit to find you     QuyteDragonSlaya:  we broke, sooooo many laws on campus hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  Omg... haha     RavNic1:  ok, do tell   QuyteDragonSlaya:  Tai was supoused to be lookin to the right, she said nothin was there,      QuyteDragonSlaya:  Well, ok first i was all speedin to get up there bein as we were all late and didn have time, and like we got every red light on kirkwood I swear, and I was passin people like nuts, agressive driveing.... which we found I am really good at, I was actually driveing better today when I didn have Chris by me bitching that I am about to do something wrong, when not worrying about it, we were fine me And Tai  QuyteDragonSlaya:  any way     RavNic1:  yayness!!! anyway     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we go up main Street.... I couldn't remember weather u said the first traffic light turn, or the last one... All I guess I really remembered was the trabant center     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so I looked for it     RavNic1:  okies   QuyteDragonSlaya:  so down main street I keep switchin lanes not sure which one to be in and passin people, goin through yellow lights lol, not bothing to stop for pedestrians like is hould     QuyteDragonSlaya:  should*     QuyteDragonSlaya:  I*     QuyteDragonSlaya:  lol     RavNic1:  good boy, don't stop for those umb college kids     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and then we trun down trabant, i told tai to keep a loom out for you.... Then i told her to keep a look out for parking.     QuyteDragonSlaya:  So we can't fidn parking, we are stressed for time so I didn feel like aprkin somewhere and walkin back... we keep passin student parking, and finally I'm like hmm.... lets just try something.. So we turn in to one about 4 blocks down and on the left     QuyteDragonSlaya:  first we went up to those lil things where u need to slide a card and it lets you pass in to the parking....     QuyteDragonSlaya:  well, we though jus by chance it maybe jus you could pay for a thing, no... so we backed out.... and were about to go back on the street when we notice     QuyteDragonSlaya:  that lil parking loops around, and comes out to our right, with no gaurder things blockin it, and jus "wrong way, and one way street" signs on it...and there was parkin at teh end of it...     RavNic1:  oh no you didn't   QuyteDragonSlaya:  So  turn to Tai and I'm like "wana be daring"  "Sure"  "hang on"  and speed down the one way parking thing hahahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  in the wrong direction hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and people all out and watchin us, givin us looks hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and we park, and on the slant you are not supoused to be able to park, amazeingly, i did it perfectly     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we jump out, and are tryin to act all casual.... haha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and of course we relize, that to park there... you need a lil pass in your window as well... which we did not.... So i am like... Ok lets make this fast befor anyone has time to get a cop or soemthiin out here....     QuyteDragonSlaya:  So we like speed walked up to trabant, and jay walked a lot to get there, not careing if we pissed people off     RavNic1:  good boy   QuyteDragonSlaya:  sorry, sis was talkin to me     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we walk around in trabant, our front of trabant, prolly acorss the street from where u are....

      Well, I was thinking Wednesday night when My mom drops Daniel off at Karate we could all meet at Regal at 5:00 and see a movie of some sort. ^.^ And you all missed it!! My mother invited Connor to the park with us. He rode his bike over and we played frisbee and stuff. Janine went crazy she wanted to meet him so bad. (Yahuk Yahuk ^_^***) Janine wants me to tell you all about Daniel and how he spit all over himself. Blah!!   Caption Contest  (Why didn't I win the last time?? Anyway, here it is:) So... I asked for some pants and all I got was this lowsy telephone... Next time I'll use Singular Wireless!

      *wishes she'd stop being sick* :p If anyone wants to blame someone for me not being there today, blame TK. I had this dream last night...well actually i had two but anyway, the first one, I thought it was today, and we were going through the normal school day, i was late so i didn't get to see TK and his scythe it'll 4th period. at lunch, we all went up to my locker, per normal except TK was really going at it with his cloak and scythe. And then he opened his locker grabbed pete, who was for some reason in there and why did i make him sound like a person?. and stabbed him with the scythe. Friut guts went everywhere and it smelled horrible! I mean, it was so nasty! Dest, Assia and I ran to the bathroom next to the dance room and D and Tai ran the other way. I woke up in my bathroom throwing up. *shivers* it was sooooo nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (pete i mean but that was too)  Ugh! the second dream i had when i got back to sleep about 7 o'clock. For some reason, we (my family) took a train to a mall where there were all these fansy resuranunts. We going to have dinner with my aunt and grandparents there. We met David and TK in front of the resuraunt, they were just there chillin' . But the i remebered i didn't have time to change from my p.j.s (i'm standing there in a mall in my pjs!)  so my dad and i went into stores trying to find a fansy outfit for me. We went into this one store and he picked up these cool sparkley pair of pants and then he said they would fit cause I was fat. HE CALLED ME FAT! and then I woke up. > *Sounds like Cho making fun of her mother* Moral of story...don't drink a bottle of v. coke when yo feel sick at 1 am in the morning then go to bed. Also, if your friend tells you they love you...DON'T PUNCH! say...thank you.

      ATTENTION DUELISTS! no i'm not going to say the quote, i just needed some sort of heading. anyway, as some of you know i went to my sister's play at her school a while ago and there are some weird things that you must know! first off, THEIR SODA MACHINES ARE OFF EVEN AFTER SCHOOL HOURS! that was some good cherry coke.. i did have to bribe hitty-smacky with a soda so she'd stop dancing and stripping on the table in front of the rest off the cast after the play. but her soda got stuck so it al worked out, HA! and yet another reason why our school is better than thiers, they don't have an autoturrium, they just set up chairs in the cafeterria. AND THEIR CAFETERRIA IS SMALLER THAN THE SENIOR LUNCH ROOM! yeah... so anyway, their smoke machine set off the fire alarm, every night so far, lol, and my sister has a reputation as a whore at her school (we won't discuss that) so thats it. oh yeah, she did try to convince me that this guy she knew is another stalker to add to my list (if you don't know the story about the first, welll... ask someone else, i am done tellin it) wjere was i, oh yes, just because he was askin my sister if i was gonna be there for the show that night than hangin around me till i left does not mean he's my stalker! don't they have to be hiding in the bushes with a camera or somethin? anyway, my sugar high is wearing off so i'm gonna go! see you all on monday, with my sythe MWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!  ps okay, i have to say it: attention duelists, i'm not wearing any pants! and dest, have you ever been to the dentist? hehehe, i'm gonna have to put up with mr thirsty a lot on monday now, but it was worth it

      Kim, you have done something horrible to me. I am having dreams with EWAN MCGREGOR!!!!!! AGGAGAGAGAGAAAAAA!!  Anyway, so I was riding on a bus with you and him sittin' there dressed up like Obi Wan. And I'm like, "gee, mister, you look familiar. What's your name?" And he's like, "Ewan Mcgregor." And I was like, "Wow. You're famous!" So then we get off the bus and he's running around training jedi and kim's having mucho fun at this point and I'm so bored. Then one of the jedi throw on a magic necklace that allows them to do like harry potter crap and I'm like... what happened to the force? "that's outdated" anyway... it was weird.  I'm advanced! go to: oekaki.n3.net and go to the advanced board! I have a pic of link up there!! :)

YOU RUINED THE DREAMMMMMMM!   Oh, by the way... I went to ringbearer.org the other day and they had lotr answering machine messages and I was like, "FUNNY! Weee!" So I wrote my own:   Legolas: Sorry I'm not availible right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you after I lather, rinse, and repeat... wait- I missed a spot--------  Aragorn: This is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. I'm not here at the moment for I am busy saving some poor pathetic race from destruction, being smelly and manly, or hanging with one of my many girlfriends. *slap* ow! *beeeeeeeep*  Arwen: Hello, this is Arwen, daughter of Peter Jennings... I mean Elrond. If You wish to talk to me, leave a message after the beep. But- If it's Aragorn, don't bother. I'm not talking to you.  Tom Bombadill: This is Tom! Are your ponies smarter than you? Are you lost in the Barrow Downs? Are you looking for a good time? Then stop on by, me and Goldberry have Karaoke every thurday and tuesday oh! But if this is Peter Jackson, I keep a machetti in my closet so don't even think of coming by!! You and your tom-less *beeeeping* script!

      Just thought I'd share a randon quote with all of you.   "Perhaps it's because I'm being slowly driven insane by a deranged Gryffindor Necromancer who wants nothing more than to get in my pants." "And what lovely pants they are!"   *sniff* Such a lovely romantic story! *sniff*
