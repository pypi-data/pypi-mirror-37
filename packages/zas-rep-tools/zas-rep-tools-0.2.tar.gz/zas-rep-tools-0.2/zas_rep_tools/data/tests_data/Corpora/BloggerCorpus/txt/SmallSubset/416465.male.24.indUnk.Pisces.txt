       Chicago's Best Burger?   So tonight for Easter dinner,  urlLink John  and I (and others) were at a restaurant debating the menu.  "CHICAGO'S BEST BURGER" the menu proclaimed. Well, well, well. We had nothing of that. Best burger? If this is true, tell me:  - How can you put a price tag on the ONE hamburger that is the best in Chicago? If the one I am eating is the best, does that mean the one the guy next to me is eating is not quite as good? Or is it better? I want to know! The name is misleading. It should be the "best hamburger s  in Chicago." Fix it.  - The only way a burger can be deemed "the best" is if it has been eaten. If it's not eaten, then what was it, the best-looking burger? best smelling? And don't tell me they could eat half of the burger and tell. What if the second half is grossly undercooked, or has a large squirming tapeworm in it? Human finger? Didn't anyone else see that episode of Buffy? Therefore you cannot base the quality of an individual burger. The name should now be " Chicago's best burger recipe(or preparation). "  - I live in Minneapolis. How am I eating Chicago's best burger if I'm not in Chicago? This is not Chicago's best burger. It may be the best burger FROM Chicago; and since it's not the burger that is the best, but the recipe, it is in actuality the " Best burger recipe(or preparation) FROM Chicago. "  - But wait! Who is to say it's the best? It is not mathematical, it was voted. Not only was it voted, but it was voted by an uneven representation of demographics! Therefore it is in actuality " Voted the best burger recipe (or preparation) FROM Chicago, as decided subjectively by a panel of individuals, having no basis in fact. Choose for yourself. "  I am all about Political Correctness, and THIS my friends is not PC.

It was hella funny.  SPEAKING of funny things. Does anyone remember that episode of the Simpsons where Homer has that lobster that he raises and he becomes buddies with it and he loves it, but then he ends up eating it? The whole time he's bawling his eyes out saying "oh you taste so good," loving how it tastes... but still crying? That was pretty funny. Ironic too.

      SOMETHING I AM WONDERING ABOUT:  On the bus today there was this couple. Kinda ugly, both of them, nothing to write home about, but they were being very affectionate and I thought it was kinda adorable, but then I realized a few things:  1: It was one-sided. He had his hand on her neck and back, rubbing her, squeezing her and such. Every once in a while she giggled, but I have seen the behavior before, it's something of a "you're mine" pet. The kind you do when you run your fingers through your retriever's hair. It disturbed me.  2: He didn't look at her. Granted, he might suffer neck strain if he did, but the entire time he looked around the bus. I was listening to music and trying to ignore the scene, but I caught him staring right at me out of the corner of my eye a few times. Now what is that? Is that the "See this? She's mine!" stare? Like 1, I have seen this before too. You look around to make sure nobody's looking at your girl. If you see someone looking at your girl, you check to make sure there is no eye contact. She was not looking at anyone, I could tell. She made it a point to look above and between people.  I'm probably paranoid, but the look in his eyes and the behavior I saw I've seen before and I didn't like it one bit. Was I wrong to want to punch him just for my assumptions? o_O

      My complaint for tonight lies solely on the shoulders of the menace that is AVANT GARDE CINEMA!  *crowd boo's and hisses*  First movie we watched tonight was some hillbilly's home movies, including a woman giving birth. They showed it, close up, beginning to end... all the blood and placenta and umbelical cords and everything. And... wow. Yeah. That didn't exactly turn me on.  Now... something else we saw was about a gay man's infatuation with sailors, and the one sailor who stayed behind after the other sailors beat the gay guy up. Then the gay sailor picked up the gay man (who was now naked) and carried him home, and they slept together, and it was so romantic.  The guy who did the second movie's name is Kenneth Anger, and I read a review about him that labeled his films as personal masturbatory material. It makes sense. "Scorpio Rising" is just people straight from the Blue Oyster Bar. Scary. Someone hold me?  Please?

           Concerned Observer:  As Christians know, aureoles (or halos) are fluffy ring-shaped clouds that hover above  the heads of Jesus, Mary, and all the saints. In every day life, the spiritual observer sees halos above the heads of righteous people, and sees devil horns  above the heads of sinners. The secular observer sees no difference.   The Devil cannot stand goodness! To mock the Lord, he has created  counterfeit halos in nuclear explosions, and rubber prophylactics. They are equally destructive.   Atomic warfare has gone out of fashion, so Satan has no choice but to promote condoms.  If they looked satanic, people wouldn't sin and use them. But fornication seems  almost righteous when any Tom, Dick, or Harry can claim that  little halo, if only for a moment.   The Bible clearly states that no Christian would use one!   Praise the Word!

      Dude. I have really not been in the mood for school work, yet school starts back up Monday and I have midterms week. What the hell is that, do you expect people to read and study and do papers over spring break? Granted, I had no reason not to since I didn't go anywhere, but the point is... the fact that I didn't go anywhere made me feel all the more reluctant to do any work, so I haven't and don't want to. Screw them.  I'm going to bed.

      My thoughts of the day:  Maury Povich: Now, it's no secret that Maury likes having little girls on his show whom he can hug and kiss and fondle to his wee heart's content. That's all fine and good, he also has freaks of nature on whom he does the same thing to. a 3' midget burn victim... *shudders* I guess you gotta take the crookeds with the straights if you want to fondle little girls. Anyway.  Yesterday as I wasted another Spring Break day I turned it to Maury, and he had the special "voyeur" show, where different people were videotaped doing "naughty" things. All well and good, right? Yeah, you know where I'm going with this, right? There was a girl of 14 who was videotaped at a mall, changing for a photoshoot... she had been caught naked, and in various states of undress.  How horrible!  Well Maury, the loving host had the girl (like 9 years later) on the show, and on the screen was -- you guessed it -- the video tape of the 14 year old girl in various states of undress! They blurred the topless scenes... but... what the hell is that? o_O  All right, I have more to bitch about, including Ricki Lake and Shipmates, but my white trash TV rant is finished for tonight!

I just have a question, for the female types... what the hell is up with those long long sweaters? They look like dresses, so when you wear pants with them, it just looks... freaky. Ghetto for sure. I'm thinking 80's when I see thick pants under a skirt, because I'm thinking leggings.   I seriously have to throw whatever those sweater things into my burning oil drum along with capri pants and peacoats. Death to all three of them!

       urlLink Libby  asked the question "How do you just... stop... doing something that has become a habit?" and that reminds me of something I've been wondering for quite a while...  I've always prided myself on self-diagnosis; on being able to fix whatever it is that is wrong with me, but that just isn't so recently. As I grow older, I grow more wary. It is to the point where I cannot even believe myself. So how the hell do I trick myself? I can't outsmart myself to unlearn a behavior, or learn a new one. I'm wise to my own tricks, and thus am stuck how I am with no chance of conscious change.  There is such a fine line between being normal and being too smart for your own good. Balancing on that line is the ability to do anything you want, mentally... the ability to teach the old dog new tricks. But for me, that ability is gone. Perhaps this dog is too old to learn new tricks, and where I was when I stumbled across that line is where I'm left to sit for the rest of my life.  Holy crap, I'm beginning to see how it's so easy to get melodramatic on a blogger. You don't mean to, but it just starts coming out as "woe is me," and again, here I am sounding like a head case. woo?

      I'll tell you what is fun: Looking at a stripper so she comes towards you, thinking you will give her money, then you look away and ignore her. She is hurt, dejected; not because of the feigned attention, but because she was not paid.  Why is that fun? Because all a strip club is is girls who pretend like you're something special with the sole intent of taking your money. You give them the money, they perform prostitutesque moves on you when nobody is looking, get up, take your cash, and leave you wanting more. This is what causes men to pay even more money for the crack-addicted trashy cousin of the stripper: the prostitute. Not only does the prostitute want your money, she also wants to give YOU a nice little gift in return in the form of an STD.  "But that's not fair!" She exclaims as she hits you over the head with the motel bible. She calls her pimp to come up and cut out your kidney, and they steal your wallet, leaving you in a bath tub full of ice cubes which have numbed your genitals so you can't yet sense the package the whore left you.  And I'm talkin DOWNTOWN!  And that, friends, is why you should never let your friends borrow your solid-fill love doll.

       New Heat Update!   I was told earlier this evening that the heat was probably well over 100 degrees in here, possibly upwards of 200 degrees. I doubt it was 200, since you know, I'd be dead and all, but it was maybe around 150. The thermostat hit 300 but the furnace couldn't quite hit that I don't think. Either way... wow, I'm alive.  Now shut up.  I need a drink!

       Immense Heat Update:   Last night, well, this morning when I lay down to sleep, my bed was hot. Unseasonably warm, and it felt like it was plugged in. Everything in this house is hot to the touch. What the shit is this?  I woke up way, way too early this morning, because it's too hot to sleep, and it's so COLD outside, and nothing can be done about it. Wah.   urlLink John  left and slept elsewhere, while I was stuck in this icky icky hot place, with only a fan... a fan in front of the radiator... blowing hot air... what the damn?  So now I embark on a journey of actually doing school work, if I can. We shall see. Highly doubt it, but I shall try!  I just remembered a dream I had last night... it was a mix of Black Knight (the Martin Lawrence "movie"), Scorpion King (mainly, just the commercial, where he's using the bow and arrow), and my own sick and twisted mind creating a magical world where a magical arrow can bring you back to life... or something gay like that. o_O  That is why unnatural heat is a bitch: It makes Bean crazy.

      WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  Hi kids!  Today's words to be thrown in the trash are Loyalty and Sincerity. If anybody knows somebody who actually could use one of these words, let them know so maybe they can come get them from the trash can; but don't mind the banana peels.  So right now, the temperature outside is maybe 40 degrees if that, and the temperature inside is probably 96. The thermostat is fucked, so I'm either going to freeze or melt. WOOOOOOOOnderful.  In other news, I put horizontal lines on the right, but that's about it for site updates. I'm sorry, I wanted to post something, and I can't think of anything funny today! :(

And sports. I don't have as many excuses to sit on my ass 24 hours a day online.  When I mentioned Summer clothes, I started hearing "Paint it Black" in my mind. And now I'm creeped out. That song is twisted as hell.  I guess that's why it's the theme song for Twisted Metal Black? [/ramble]  Oh yeah, and yesterday was my first day back to school after a 5-day weekend.

      So I didn't go to class yesterday due to a migraine. I couldn't think straight and was in a shitload of pain when I went to bed so I emailed my teachers and put them in the outbox to be sent in the morning. When I got up to send them, I checked and saw they were already sent and replied to!  Well, the one wasn't replied to until later when the teacher told me he hopes my hangover gets better. I laughed at that, then thought to myself... DAMN IT! I wasn't drinking, and even if I was, I don't get hangovers, so that's just wrong. Perhaps I should reply to his e-mail and set him straight. o_O  Yes, yes you're right. It's been three days since I've posted and I needed something to mention and I couldn't think of anything.  Well, me and  urlLink John  played basketball today cause it's nice out. That was my day.  How was yours? :|

      So instead of doing homework all day, I've been playing Madden, going out to lunch with my brothers and then a thought came to me while I was in the library, doing a crossword puzzle: What kind of crossworder are you? Do you like to wait until you've got them all figured out before filling them in, or do you like to write over, or erase anything you have wrong? Me, I go as far as I can without editing and if I get one wrong and I get stuck, I quit. I rule like that.   Anyway, all night I've been trying to find a crossword puzzle maker, and FINALLY I found one and it rules bigtime. So, I've made a crossword puzzle about things found on my site. All five of my readers, let's see how well you do:  urlLink click here  to do my crossword.

      In the last half hour of the day I thought I would give you all a thrilling recap of my Friday, April 5th, nineteen ninety twelve.  Around midnight, I passed out from being sick and exhausted from a harrrd week of, well, classes. Okay so it wasn't hard, but it still tired me out cause I'm sick.  I get up at quarter to eight and hop on here for a while, then go downstairs for some banana bread and to finish my game of Madden.  Then, it's off to my brother's for a long day of driving in his peacup, and napping while he ran in places. Then I bought a DVD; then we made more stops (one to the liquor store) and eventually came home. Left around noon and came back around six.   So, he bought his DirecTV and it got set up. Played some Virtua Fighter 2 with him (and drank) and Pokemon Stadium 2 with his daughter, and then we watched about 600 channels of tv (whilst drinking). After the kids went to bed, Skinemax came on and we watched some Emmanuelle something or other, a softcore porn about a hot blonde with mind control devices and pierced nipples. I give it four stars.  Then I came home. And now I want to pass out again. I'm tired.  First, I gotta go pick on a certain drunk girl some more... ;)

      What's my problem?  I sit on my ass for half a semester and then midterms come around, I'm stressed out (for reasons other than midterms) in fact, I can't even study for midterms... but I take them, expect to get a C or worse, and end up getting 102%. That's kool.   Another Tale From the Bus   I love Minnesota Metro Transit. The bus drivers must all be subjected to psychological tests, because after driving around in the worst traffic ever, in the bitter cold, they're still good people.  I often hear about places not having any busing at all, much less a high-quality system like here.  My question to you:  What's the public transportation like there? o_O

Does anybody find this look hip or attractive in the least? I think it's horrible, but maybe I'm missing something. Kixx, what's your opinion?

       I just realized something.   I'm all alone.  I looked out my window tonight on the way home and saw a sorority house: "Technical Women Students."  Why don't I get that? Every minority gets their own group, their own club, somewhere to fit in. The only group for fat people and heavy drinkers end in "Anonymous," and the sole purpose is to STRIP YOU of those traits. Society just wants me to be a normal, boring, young adult middle class white male with no known distinguishing characteristics.  I'm not a frat boy. I'm not stupid and slutty or average looking enough. Plus, I hate beer, and I suck at frisbee. My parents aren't rich, and I don't like the concept of pledging. I don't embarass myself for acceptance. I just sit on my ass and ask for it while doing nothing.  I'm an English major. What do I do? I could be in an artsy book club, but I don't read. I'm not a pseudo-intellectual I'm an actual fucking intellectual. I'm smart but only as smart as I am. I do not act any smarter. I do not use lots of big words and I don't quote people. I do not fit in with my own group. I have no group. As "up myself" as I am, I'm nowhere near where I should be and that is sad.  I need some horn rimmed glasses and a black turtle neck and start writing poetry because this whole "being unique" bullshit is not all it's cracked up to be.

       Slackers   Wow. This movie rocked. John will agree with me when I say...this movie rocked.  In a sea of unoriginal comedy, this little fishy had many complex characters, and by complex I mean really fucked up and unpredictable and Laura Prepon rules. Usually I like it when the straight man is as zany as the comic relief, and this was no different... Devon Sawa... eh. Allow me to be shallow here: He needs braces. In a world that ridicules Jewel to no end about her teeth, Devon Sawa needs some fucking braces.  Anyway, Slackers almost made me hate it with the evilness of Jason Schwartzmann, but still... certain parts of the film were funny. I won't ruin the jokes, because joke ruiners are stupid.  But I will ruin this commercial I've seen, don't know if any of yall have seen it:  These two kids are standing in a field on a farm, they are saying something about the Burger King Big Kids meal, when they ponder "how will we get there?" at which point they turn to the family horse and they have an epiphany.  The next scene shows the two kids sitting in the cab of a pickup truck, with the horse behind the wheel, driving. I don't know if this commercial is intentionally hilarious, but I cracked up watching it, and John laughed just hearing aboot it. Funny.  Also: In my recent brainwashing at the hands of MTV 2 I have fallen in love with Norah Jones. Is that wrong? I know that MTV 2 are just MTV in disguise... but I can't help it. I'm a sucker for a pretty voice. And so impressionable...

      BATS!@!@#@%@$^%&*U%^%$$#@  All right so my house is special, yall. You know how lots of houses have little doggie doors? Well not so much because of skinny burglars, but in the movies all houses have doggie doors. Anyway, my house has a special bat door. Every summer is bat season; every winter, mouse season. Like clockwork, there's another bat in my basement. There will be about five in all this year, as in every other year. They are pretty good about staying in the basement, but sometimes they don't.  DATELINE CIRCA 1985 CE, my brothers and I are playing on the hide-a-bed in the den (I think), when a great big black thing comes up from the basement. I, being the brave little five-year-old I am, dive under the hide-a-bed and, well, hide. This was my earliest bat memory.  DATELINE LIKE A FEW YEARS AGO, I was washing my face down in the basement, as there is no working sink above the basement, when I see something moving in the washer to my left. My glasses were off so it was just black and furry and moving, so I slammed the cover, assuming it was a bat or something bat-like. Lo and behold, one cold-rinse cycle later, the shivering, unconscious bat was removed from the washer and released into the wild, alive. Good stuff.  DATELINE I FORGOT, MAYBE TWO YEARS BEFORE THE LAST ONE, I was sitting on my computer chit chatting with people when a bat came up. Me, being the brave upper-teen teenager I was, hit the deck and came upstairs, signing online up here. I am sure some of the people I knew back then may recall this. It was quite funny, oh it was indeed.   Later on, as I gathered the courage, I hunted this damned bat. It was no floozie bat, it did not go home the next morning. I grabbed my AWESOME blow gun and shot its wing with a blow dart. Eventually it flew away so I can't prove that I have good aim, but I thought I got him (sorry Kelly). I am pretty sure he/she/it was ok though. However, I got a blow dart stuck in my ceiling. Kinda sucked. Got it out though, but I believe Josh and/or Sam broke the mouthpiece of the gun as it was on my floor, since I am a messy bastard. Anywho, I can't shoot anymore bats, b'gorrah, and I was fin ta, too, to have lunch for tomorrow....  TTFN.

      Vanilla Sky  So I saw this movie tonight. I didn't really want to see it, as I have honed the ability to tell a shitty movie from its commercials, and this movie had some of the worst. It's a damned shame that the advertising was so horrible, because I really really liked it.  Now, I'm still as skeptical as ever, and fully realized this was just another head trip of a movie witholding vital information in an attempt to throw you off making you think you've been fooled, but the ways Vanilla Sky worked were very new and, erm, for lack of a better term, kicked ass.  One reviewer for the film had said there were too many twists and turns, so many that they lost their effectiveness. Listening to him I thought "Wow! That really sucks!" After seeing it, however, I cannot believe how thoroughly he missed the point. For those keeping score, he was some Minneapolis News reviewer, I think. Anyway, one thing I noticed about Vanilla Sky was that every time something happened that I wanted to talk about, I had no chance to say so. The plot just moved too quickly. I couldn't avert my eyes for a second without missing something -- and not everything missed was all that important, either. That doesn't matter; what matters is that I was on my heels for most of the movie and wasn't given time to fully think about what was happening.  To my credit, though, I almost figured it out. As I said, certain things were omitted to make you feel like you weren't smart enough to get it. To avoid spoiling the movie, I will avoid spoiling the movie, but anyway...  Part two of this funky rhyme, G(Something of a spoiler, indeed):  I caught the eeriest feeling when Aames finally found Sophia, up until he woke up the next morning. What feeling? Well, the feeling that I could relate to his life as it existed at that moment. The way she treated him, his reaction... it was soopa powerful for me because I know what that feels like.  All right, now, to lighten the mood (for me, not for you, asshead), here's a dancing skeleton:

      Two un-touched-upon points:  1: A cowboy movie with Kelso from That 70's Show, Usher and Dawson from Dawson's Creek? OH MY GOD that's going to kill Spiderman at the box office! o_O Seriously though... just... what the hell? My brain just exploded all over the friggin place. That's the worst trio of stars any movie could ever fathom! Argh! And not even Rachael Leigh Cook can save it, unless she gets all nekkid... and shows up in my room... but you know the chances of that happening are like, 2:1.  2: So now MTV is going to be sued for some fucking IDIOT teenager who set himself on fire in his back yard as his parents were busy ignoring him, and making sure he couldn't read the disclaimer about not doing stuff they do on "Jackass" at home. I personally saw the episode where they set themselves on fire, and the instructor was pretty explicit that you can easily die if you do it... so could this boy not comprehend English? Was he watching and saying "fiiiiiiiire coooooooool?" If you're stupid enough to ignore the warnings, and you know, have a COMPLETE wont of common sense, you have larger problems than media influence, you've gotta see a shrink, and a tutor, and possibly Kevorkian, because if you're over five years old and you can't figure out that it's bad to set yourself on fire, there is little to no hope for you.   Just let those kinds of people out on their own; a speeding bus will eventually end their suffering when they wander into traffic.

       The Origins of AlphaBean: Part 1  (It's in reverse order, remember?)  Q: "Why do you prefer Bean over Scott?"  A: It's a many-faceted explanation, which is undoubtedly too complex for your simple minds. Just kidding. First of all, I like it as a nickname. It suits me, it's silly... and it's not "Scottie." I hate hate hate being called "Scottie" and you may ask 'well then why did you go by Scottie when you first came around?' and I will answer you that it was the only thing I could come up with that in the tiniest bit described who I was. I have found the moniker to do so in AlphaBean.  Also, in the past year, I have grown ashamed of the name Scott. It has come to signify things I can't comprehend and that disgust me. If I do not see myself as Scott, I cannot fall into that same hole. At least I fucking hope that's true ;)  I have another reason, one more personal... but I'm not going to be a Drama Bean here and type it out. All you need to know is that I prefer to be called Bean than Scott. At least online. For some reason, having anyone call me one thing after calling me another for as long as they've known me, just doesn't sit well. I'm not a big fan of change.  That is all.

       What's an AlphaBean?   Okay so Dana (link to the right) questioned a couple of things tonight: 1) Why do I prefer being called Bean over Scott, and 2) What the fuck is an AlphaBean?  Well let's go in reverse order:  32 years ago on the streets of Manila, there lived a little pauper boy named Scott. That was me. Except it wasn't Manila, it was Minnesota. And it wasn't the street... it was my couch. And it wasn't 32 years ago... it was, like, three. Oh, and I was never a pauper. I am a PRINCE. You hear me? PRINCE!!!!  Anyway, I had just bought a laptop (which has long since been destroyed), and also bought the game Worms 2. I was the daddy at that game, and my squad, whose names I've forgotten, were led by one Alpha Bean. Basically, he was the leader, and his name was Bean. He fucking ruled. He was usually the only worm I had left on the more tricky, difficult levels. ANYWAY.  I had been known on the internet as Scottie, ScottieW, ScoTTieX, and then Spifferz. Spifferz was so gay, but I was told it was close enough to ScoTTieX that it was ok. Well I made a drastic change and adopted the name of my favorite worm, AlphaBean. Now, I am world-famous and so is my name. In fact, even javascript fuckers have stolen my name to use on their code. That is irrelevant. Basically, I'm now me, and you all have been graced by my glorious humility and character.  I'm so special that I think I'll wait until tomorrow for part 1, so that this doesn't end up being too long of a post.

      Knee Brace!  I've found what I've been missing all these years. I have been in dire need of a knee brace. Later on I think I'll post the story about my broken leg and the ensuing problems, but right now I'll just say that when I was 11 my femur was broken, and ever since I've had a pretty weak quad and the way I walked from it resulted in a permanent, I don't know what it's called, but my feet are bent inward and my kneecaps go outward and it's a bitch, and is resulting in arthritic symptoms.  Anyway, I got the brace, and I can actually run, and bend my knee, and it doesn't hurt, and my leg goes straight up. It's funny that for some reason I hadn't gotten one before... you know, in 11 years. o_O  So this isn't an entertaining post or funny or anything... I'm sorry. I think all my funny evaporated with the alcohol from last night. I still haven't told yall about that yet, and I won't... yet. Not tonight.  Also, Samantha's site is almost done. I just have to get bored enough to open Dreamweaver up on my P2 333 with 64 megs ram again. :P  OH MY GOD I have chronic boringness today. I'm gonna stop the bleeding and end this post quickly.

For the uninformed, Heather = blonde, usually falsely tanned, "like, omigod" young woman, of which there are thirty BILLION in Minnesota.  They're generally pretty cute, though with makeup and tanning, you can never be sure if you're really just attracted to a robot in disguise. Or, you know... an exact replica of yourself.  SO. I've heard quite a few great stories tonight. I'm way too drunk to tell them right now, so I will wait until tomorrow or such.  I'm really ashamed that I don't go drinking more.  Anyway... On a scale of 1-10 I just told a friend I was about 7.5 which is pretty damned drunk, so I'm going to go pass out, since my work here... is done. What work, you ask?  DIE.

      Woo.  I still have lots of polishing to do, but at least now my blog is being advertised and the redesign is done, so I can rest easily. I believe I am supposed to take the opportunity to make a shout out to blogsnob... not like they need to be advertised, but... o_O  Oh, and I'm not gay if you were wondering. :)  I've posted two measly excerpts from conversations on the Convos section, still waiting for people to start putting stuff up. I've invited BurnZy so hopefully he will get it going sufficiently.  Future projects for me include making a section for Sammi Jo, who is Josh's big sister, so you can see some pictures of her on Josh's page. I'm also going to work on my family tree, and I'll be uploading it -- I dunno if I'm going to make it public though. I suppose it's for the best so I know if I'm related to any of you before you try scoring with me. o_O   That was a joke.

      All right so I gave in.  I am so desperate for attention and for my little counter to go up, that I'm joining webrings. What this means is I want people visiting, and I want people clicking that little "comment" link under my posts. Do you hear me?  As I've said to Joanna (no link for her, but she comments from time to time), we should begin a life of crime. This whole nothing-to-blog existence is getting to me, it really is. What can I say? I don't do much. It's summer now, and work is such a bitch that I am easily spent, so I sit around playing videogames.  So hi kids, I rented NBA2k2 last week and played it. I'm not very good. I don't really play enough video games anymore, because there aren't any good multiplayer games outside of sports.  I'm thinking about adding a TV rant section to my site so I can discuss what happened on the few shows I watch: WWE Wrestling, Smallville, Dark Angel(rip) and all the trashy hookups shows like Elimidate, and Shipmates. Everyone needs a forum to discuss Elimidate!  And now, as people are checking out my site for reviews and such, they see just what a pathetic loser I am, and I will forever be labeled as such. :(  So this is a long rant, perhaps I should work on my template and shrink the font some more so it looks like I didn't type so much.  I wish I could post more funny shit on here, but I think for that I need to start drinking more religiously. I haven't been to a liquor store in a few weeks, so I have nothing to aide me to that end. So until that day...  Battle on, Xena! [thumbs up]

      You know what sucks ass?  Asian chicks don't dig the big guys. That's a damn shame, because I like the Asian chicks.    You know what else sucks? Drinking so much you embarass yourself, but you don't drink enough that you can't remember embarassing yourself. God damn it, I'd prefer to wake up tied to a tree with my head shaved and my pants around my ankles and not know what the hell happened, than to wake up the next morning and be ashamed.  On the plus side... once again, no hangover. I'm such a hangoverless pimp.  On the negative side... I was mumbling incoherently in my sleep, and since I had passed out in John's chair, he got to hear it all and laugh at me.  In my defense: I brought a bottle of Cuervo Margarita to the party to share, but nobody would share, so I just kept taking cups of it until it was gone. Also, I hadn't been to sleep because of final papers. So, there I was falling asleep in the computer lab at school waiting for a ride to go to the party, then I get there and get shitfaced. O_o And when I drink, I can't sleep... so that just sucked.  And needless to say, I asked a guy at the party to drop me off somewhere along a certain street but forgot to tell him where on the street. So I was drunk, lost, but somehow made it to the bus stop. I rule! o_O  OK no I don't.  God, I keep getting flashbacks.

Dark Angel is directed by James Cameron tonight, 90 minutes of greatness co-starring Lita from the WWF.

       Mr Deeds   FUCK THAT. Not worth a Beanie Review. It was a remake, but all they did was threw some jokes on top of it instead of actually doing anything. It seemed more like a home video of Sandler and his friends than an actual movie. I wasted a lot of money on the movie and I WANT IT BACK. :(   Lilo and Stitch   I loved this movie. It was actually funnier than 'Deeds' because it used wit and intelligence instead of "HOLY SHIT THAT'S WICKED FUCKED UP MAN" humor. It was intelligent and pretty mature, with more cohesion despite the twist-ful finish than 'Deeds."   I totally love the mischievous little alien and see myself slightly in that role, except I'm big, human, not a cartoon, and not infinitely intelligent.  Anyway, the best part of the film was when Stitch uses his powers to be constructive at the request of Lilo. I'm not spoiling anything, but look out for it, and you'll see what I mean.  I went to see the movie in Thunder Bay at some big theater with huge screens, and it was all kids (not many though), and John and I laughed our asses off when the kids didn't and it was awkward.   I want you all to watch three movies: Lilo and Stitch, The Bourne Identity, and The Shipping News. Yup.

      And now I'm back... from outer space... you just walked in to....etc...  All right well I just returned from Canada and upper Minnesota on vacation, and I had written out a list of interesting things I noticed about Canada, but I don't know where the list is right now so I will post that later. I just want to say hi, and talk about casinos.  We stopped at two casinos, one to and one from our destination. Both times I couldn't help but get depressed, as though I was in a hospital surrounded by unhappy, sick and dying people. I couldn't even handle it without alcohol, which is why I got quite depressed sober the second time around.  First of all there are the slots. This is where Social Security checks are wasted. In Canada, the elderly Americans take buses to buy their prescriptions cheaper, and on the way back they sit at the slots for HOURS and HOURS just throwing their money away. Outside of the occasional new 18 year old hanging out with friends, I haven't seen one person smile at the slots. NOT EVEN THE WINNERS! Jackpots are won, hundreds and hundreds of dollars... yet these people just stare X_X it's depressing. These people need friends worse than I do.  That leads me to my next casino area: The tables. This is where the most serious of the serious stay. Blackjack is what got people killed in the Old West, and if concealed weapons were legal today I am sure there would be many gambling-related deaths. If you take a hit when you're not supposed to or stand on a low number you gain a handful of enemies for life, because it's not just a game. The heads of the casino march in and out of the table room with armed guards watching over your every move. You can't talk or you might distract somebody. Your actions must be crisp and mathematical and you must obey strict rules. It's a game!   Holy Jesus I think I took my last trip to the casino yesterday. I don't usually care about what other people do with their lives, but I have to make an exception here. Casinos are exploitative trash and I'm not setting foot in another one again.   GRR! Anyway... hiya!

       The Shipping News   I loved this movie. I think maybe I was tricked by the quirkiness of it all... of all the characters and all the situations... Judi Dench did things I'd never expect from someone who was knighted... and many times I looked at the screen thinking... "what the fuck?"  I've been a big big huge fan of Julianne Moore as long as I can remember. She's just ungodly beautiful even at 40+ and she's a better actress than most of the trash out there (Julia Roberts). I've been a huge fan of Kevin Spacey since Outbreak, but lately I've gotten tired of him. Especially K-Pax. That was the worst movie ever. However, in Shipping News, he's solid. Granted, he was overshadowed by his supporting cast, but not buy much. The character he portrayed was complex enough that just saying he was this way or that way wouldn't suffice... so he did well.  Again... wonderful supporting cast. This movie felt very real and if it wasn't for Moore's statuesque larger-than-life beauty, I would never have thought about it being a movie.   The Shipping News was a bit slow to start, and it never really speeds up too much, but it plays like a home movie you don't want to rush, if you can put your mind in the right place. If you're looking for profundity or mindless action look elsewhere. The shame with The Shipping News is, while it's not an action movie, I am sure it would have been so much better in the theater. The 55" TV and surround sound stereo just couldn't capture it like a theater would.  You know, I went to see The Royal Tenenbaums last week and never reviewed it... I suppose I will eventually.  Also... I know I review videos and I think "The Bourne Identity" was the only new release I actually have discussed... but then I'm not all that into seeing new movies, or videos for that matter. My family rents maybe five videos a week and I only watch at most one of them. So... whatever. It's something to post when you have nothing else to post.  I do have a question, though... I have been trying to figure out a system to post stories and allow people to critique them online... does anyone have any suggestions on how to do that?

      All right so I watch a lot of TV and a lot of movies, and I see people with whom, personality-wise, I can relate. They mean well, but they put foot in mouth often, have major flaws, but in the end, while this gets them in trouble... they always end up all right, no harm done.   In the real world, I see everyone trying to be cooler than everybody else. People don't want to say what they're thinking, or say what they feel, they don't want to deal with the consequences, and they don't want to "take any risks." Tactless people with heart-on-sleeve are often looked down upon, usually because the majority of them are viewed to be substance abusers of some sort, or clinically insane.   Anyway...   I'm noticing more and more that I can deal with glaring lapses of personality, and even with stupidity to a point, and generally only dislike people for what they do -- not who they are. I have grown accustomed to tuning out tactless comments, and can converse quite well with some of the more serious cases.   Still, though... I think life needs to more imitate art... to accomodate the intellectually clumsy instead of forcing more and more people to conform and close off. I'm a fuckup but I'm not a bad person, at least I don't think I am, and I'd really like to have a place in this world. Do I need to start a support group for fuckups?   As some of you know, one of the things I believe in is laying the cards on the table... to let people see inside without having to dig, beg, or guess. What I say is what comes to mind at that exact moment. Sometimes I mean it, sometimes I don't... it gets me in trouble often, but how I am in real life is the exact opposite: I say nothing for fear of how it will affect me. With close friends and family I will say what I want to say and sometimes that gets me in huge big trouble as it does on here or anywhere else... but if I didn't speak my mind, I wouldn't speak at all. I just try convincing myself that some of the good I say makes up for some of the bad I say. I want to see some more people talk out their ass so I wouldn't have to feel so alone.

      Two review-type thingies.   The Bourne Identity : Matt Damon an action star? It's true. He pulled it off as well as anyone else could, and gave the character the right amount of, what, innocence? I don't know if I could like him in many action movies -- especially since I am not a big Damon fan, but I loved this movie. It was not overacted or CGI-laden, just a good solid action movie with a bit of thinking involved.  Now, I will have to see TBI again since midway through the film I was afflicted with too-much-mello-yello syndrome and I will spare the gory details, just rest assured the film seemed to run another four hours. Jurassic Park II was forever ruined for me for that reason, though it was a shitty movie to start with, but I still enjoyed TBI as much as possible.   HOWEVER! When the movie was over I was like "FINALLY!" but the line... well it didn't move. It took another 10 minutes to get out of the theater, and when I got out of the theater I took advantage of my size and maneuverability, and made a mad dash through all the small women. I felt kinda bad... but then, I also didn't care. It happens.  OBSERVATION: That movie had lots of old people, most on dates, but quite a few on their own. I was surprised... but then I also noticed there were many young kids there; leaving the theater I heard a group of Jr. High age girls saying "But... what happened here, and who was that?" and I had a chuckle.      Blackhawk Down : Wasn't such a bad movie, but interestingly enough that movie has made me think more than any other movie I've seen this year. Seriously... there were maybe 40 characters, all with bald heads and white whom you had to keep track of, so John and his girlfriend asked quite a bit "who is that?" or something similar... and I had the same problem at times.  ANYWAY. Pretty long, and the "funny" things seemed a bit out of place. I always feel pretty shitty after seeing a "based on true story" movies because I question the validity of certain "holes in the plot" or other such things. Such as... at the end,  the people who were fighting the entire time were forced to run alongside the convoy, while the fresh military men were sitting in there saying "sorry no room!"? Did that really happen? That one guy was wounded and he had to run all the way out of town.  I mean really. I think... that's SHITTY if it's true, and if it's not... then what was the point?  When they show all the casings hitting the ground towards the end... what was the point in that? Nothing, really. Things like that scream "RUSHED" to me.  Also a few minor gripes about Josh Hartnett: He looks 17 in this film. His voice is cracking so much you'd think he just started puberty. He's leading them, yet he is taking orders from everyone else. He's looking to others for advice. He is weak and useless until the end. Most of the movie is him preaching. This movie did too much verbal preaching. I think certain moments where the sound stopped and the camera went to slo-mo you can see the point of the film.... but they kept on preaching. That was not necessary. Oh my god this mosquito bite is killing me.     Other things to say: Okay I already mentioned the mosquito bite so that's out of the way...  Sobe Nirvana is good stuff.  I like songs by Sheila Nicholls.  There is nothing cooler than seeing a girl's thong through her skirt.  HOWEVER, there is nothing that ruins that moment worse than seeing her dad staring at the same thing you are. That's creepy and now it's no longer a fantasy, it's a sad/funny anecdote. Bah.  I'm sad. Someone clean my mind of icky thoughts and replace them with nice dirty thoughts!

      Okay I have a dilemma. Okay it's a... trilemma.  I'm trying to figure out which nickname for Libby I like best.  In my old archives I saw that I called her spongehead, so  1) Spongehead.  2) Rainbow Brite  3) Leebee  Those are the names I've given her. There are other possibilities but since I've given her these three nicknames I want to know which of the three suits her best. While her "name" is Leebee, she is a spongehead, and it's bright red like Rainbow Brite, so the answer could easily be any of the three, really.  Your thoughts?

What I Would Do For Fun If I Was Filthy Rich   All right, first off what good is being rich without war games with your buddies... right? So I will buy dune buggies (or ATV's) for me and all my peeps for a nice all-terrain game of paintball (or laser tag... or something).   I would also buy my own small town next to my Emu ranch, and have an annual "running of the emu" in my small town. You're all invited.  Also, I would buy everything on  urlLink Gadget Masters  and  urlLink Gadget Central  etc. WoOoooOoOOo.  Hmm...   I think I would also buy my block and create an elaborate mansion underneath all the humble little houses. That'd be kewl. People would be like   "Where's Bean's house?"   "Right there"  "You mean that tan/brown one?"  "Um... I guess... and the white/blue one... and like, the rest of the block."  "No no no that's more than one house."  "No... it's not"  Oh yeah. *dx*

      Like all of my big posts, this is extremely unpolished and probably makes no sense at all at times, but it's something that's been on my mind I want to talk about.  All right now I know this is old hat for most people... to think yeah yeah the media controls the nation... but when you think about it, WE only think about how the media controls us in a major way, such as leftist propoganda, gender roles, etc.  More and more lately I've been seeing what media is doing on a micro level -- as in, not just advertising products, but altering society to center around a certain product.  What I have in mind in this case is rap music. I mean beer is beer; alcohol is alcohol and if you're going to get drunk, get drunk. But in the 1980s not only were impressional urban youths being told to consume something, they were being told that if they didn't, they did not belong.   I was talking to residue last night about this (well, something marginally different, but we touched on this) that certain things are considered "black" or "white" or "asian" or "latino;" eg. hot sauce. I mentioned liking it and he said "I thought that was a black thing!" and I said "Oh, I just thought it was a fat thing..."  Now that's just a tangent and not my point particularly, the point being that certain things are social "things," BUT WHY? How the hell is there a universal beverage for your race, or hat for your social circle?  Why do people look at Zima and say "homo drink!" or Malt Liquor and say "AHAHA black drink!"?  More importantly... why do all college students drink beer?  Was it as common before Animal House? Yeeeah probably, but I do know that Animal House was the start of people thinking they HAD to do certain things in college: Join frat, drink lots of beer, dress in togas, and be promiscuous. It was no longer what benefitted you the most or was the most fun, it was the universal code.  "Back then you didn't smoke weed because it was the thing to do, you smoked it because it got you high"  --Willie Nelson in "Half Baked."  Then the late 80s and early 90's roll around and rap stars talk about walking around with a joint or a blunt hanging out of their mouth. No longer was it a pasttime, it was a lifestyle. I go drinking on the weekends because I would prefer to handle the week sober, is that so wrong?  Even in the black and white era of movies, there were two constants: 1, when you came home from a hard day's work, you poured yourself a glass of a nondescript alcohol, or, later, had yourself a beer. You know what I like to do after a hard day's work? Shower, drink something that quenches my thirst, and relax. What does alcohol do? It forces you to relax. If you are not relaxed after working hard, then maybe you should go do something else, because you're not exhausted and there's no reason to "wind down." :wtf:  The other constant is cigarettes: When you're a guy and you smoke, you're cool. You're hip. You're aloof. When you're a woman and you smoke you're seductive, exotic and mysterious. Why is that? Because you have bad breath? Brown teeth? You wheeze like a pig? Your car stinks and has a bunch of burn holes on the driver's seat, and when your convertible is opened up the ashes fly out and get in people's eyes?   I know you're probably thinking "Yeah yeah Bean, we know that already," but I was just giving the two classic examples of how the media forms a lifestyle.  Perhaps later on I'll post something about gender roles (I've learned that there's a whole lot more to it than people think.), and perhaps later another topic.

I just realized that dana and Mike both call me Scott and I haven't known them for TOO long, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I suppose there has to be a certain level of trust and/or friendship to be called by my real name, as though I knew them in real life.  On a less serious note, I need to spruce up the page so I don't have to beg for people to visit and/or reply. I need some sort of weekly section or something. Short fiction?

       Undercover Brother   Saw it tonight... was a funny film. Three movie reviews in one week. I don't think I watched three movies over the last year and here I have three in one week. So anyway, I'd have to watch it again and pay attention to detail if I was to give it an Ebertine dissection, but basically it was damn funny, especially since Dave Chapelle is GOD. Half Baked = best movie ever. Anyway... I did think maybe he was overplayed, but... that's not even a bad thing, since he was the funniest person in the movie. And Doogie Hauser...  Tomorrow is pit day. A day in the searing heat bent over picking up rocks for hours and hours... doesn't it sound sexy? OH YEAH YOU KNOW IT!  So I got my grades back... A A- B+ EH For having three classes only they sucked, but for my first semester back after 10 months it... eh... not so bad. These were upper division courses (cept for the fiction writing I got an A in) so I'm pretty proud. Um... yeah. That's about it.  Nobody's replying to my blog anymore. I'm starting to get all sad. :( see? That's me frowning. Heartless people.

       As the Buzz Fades...   So now... I'm left bored. My two major haunts, Haligh and Libby have stopped posting because of a pair of losers who need to be thrown down the UP escalator at their local mall, and because of this... I am just uninspired for blogging.  People ask, "Bean, why haven't you updated?" and it's not like I can give them the same reason. Nobody likes me enough to stalk me... if a girl stalked me, I would appreciate it, and probably freak her out because I'm so clingy. I'd be like "Awwww you weren't outside my window today... where were you?!?! DID YOU FIND ANOTHER GUY TO STALK? DO YOU HATE ME NOW?" And she'd file a restraining order. Because I am that cool.  You know what I need? A nice cool 8-) smilie from AIM. I'm addicted to it lately. Cool smilie all over the place. 8-) (H) :cool: depending on where I talk to you, you name it, I have finally learned how to type it on a keyboard so that's what I am. KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.  My days... well my days are getting shorter. My nights... longer. I'm having less and less to blog about as the Summer wanes, but fear not loyal (or slutty) readers, I plan on beginning a crime spree right before school starts... and then they can't catch me, as I'll be blending in to the campus crowd!  Now... it has come to my attention that Libby thinks her sole purpose for existing is NOT to entertain me, yet I am trying to figure out a way to convince her otherwise... any suggestions?  I HAVE DECIDED that since nobody will submit to  urlLink Open Mic Night , that I need a new gimmick... a new method of getting people to give a shit... so I got an idea... let me know what you think:  Lately I've been finding myself more and more hard-pressed to recall things from my childhood, and this FREAKS ME OUT man. Distressing as hell. I have decided that if I start writing out memories from my childhood, not only will I remember more, but I'll have them recorded for when I get older and forget everything... and I'd like you all to participate with me.  I'm taking down the "critiques" from the site, as critiquing shouldn't happen on memoirs ;) but I would like you all to write to me describing, IN DETAIL, your earliest memory. Doesn't have to be pretty, doesn't have to be any specific length... just email it to me and I'll tell the world ASAP.  PLEASE participate? Pretty please? *puppy dog eyes*

       Kung POW!   I just got done watching this movie and I laughed a whooooooooooole lot. It was just a whole movie of o_O O_o moments, and definitely worth it to go see. If you haven't seen it... see it. That is, if you like stupid humor. This has lots of it. The second scene of the movie was so fucked up... oi. Go rent it and tell me what you think about the second scene, right before the credits ;)  Also, I wanted to discuss Amelie because I finally rented that last week. I really liked it, and wish it could be remade in English so some of the more ADD-riddled people can watch and enjoy it. Definitely an interesting film, with an adorable star. Yeh.

If you haven't played it or seen anything about it, you're playing God in an environment like Age of Empires, and you are basically apprenticing a newborn baby creature, either a cow, orangutan or a tiger.

      PIMPEST SHIT EVER.  All right peeps, check it.  I'm really drunk right now... really drunk... and so is John. We each got like 10 shots extra tonight because....  JOHN WON $250.00!!!!!  That's right. It was like, Hawaiian night or somthing tonight, and whomever got the most lais, male and female, would share  500 350  250 dollars. They would also get a chance to win a jet ski. Well here's the dilly:  The girl who won had 73 lais. John had 16. He got these from a) 5 from our party, b) 3-4 from our party, who got them from guys, but the rest were ALL HIM. He totally whored himself out to the girlz at the bar, a waitress, a beer girl, all for lais. No other guy had ANY lais, so John just straight up won 250 bucks. He gave 20 each to the girls in our party, we bought maybe 20 bucks worth of booze and are splitting the rest. Question for my peeps: What should we buy? I want either a new video game console, or a new weight bench. Beings as I'm a big fatty, I should probably get the wieght bench. What do you, my peeps, suggest?  *edit*The guy who SHOULD have won had like 50 lais but he was ONE FUCKING MINUTE late and John won. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA so we feared getting beaten because the guy was tres pissed that he was too late and John won. We laughed at him. It was great. OH YEAH.  Oh man, we were screaming and celebrating so much tonight. The girlz were all over John for being a stud. It was really great.  Background: It's Janet, my sister in law, Jay's wife's birthday on Sunday... we went out for mexican, embarassed Jay, a lot, had three margaritas, went to the bar, had a double j&c, four j&c's, a jello shot, smirnoff ice, and nine shooters (kamikaze etc). JOHN had: Two margaritas, four long beach iced teas(aka long island with cranberry instead of coke) two jello shots and 10 shots. The Mall of America is brutal on the checkbook, but omg WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO John can I get a WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO?  Also, at the bar the bartender and a waitress were in Bikinis. That broke my heart. :(  All right so um, I can't remember what else. i'll post more kool stuff.  PS: I'm on a pimp new computer now.woo?

       urlLink Education Minnesota   I've decided I have a cause I want to fight for. I have shown hints of this, and of that in the past, but nothing (except being pro-life, which isn't worth all the arguing), pisses me off CONSISTENTLY like Jesse "the pigfucker" Ventura's treatment of Minnesota education.  My favorite anecdote on the situation: The University of Minnesota, MY University of Minnesota, is in the top five schools in the nation for medical schools... and their payroll is not even in the top TWENTY!  Pigfucker's argument? "Why would any professor make more than the Governer of Minnesota?" And with that, he demanded salary cuts.  I hate Ventura. I really really do, and I want to beat his ass, too. Actually, I want to beat his son Ray-Ray's ass, because I'm sure Ventura could still rip my heart out. I would beat Ashtray's ass and then maybe in 30 years I will pay a visit to old pigfucker in the 'home.  Feh.     In Canada I was drinking with a few Canucks and we talked about a bunch of stuff -- did I post about this? Doesn't matter -- One thing that came up was that the young woman I was talking to was going to school for... was it sociology? And she was going to be a teacher. When she heard I was in Liberal Arts she didn't wince like Americans do. Why not? Because in Canada, there is GOOD MONEY in teaching. Apparently the teachers union up there owns a large food... manufacturer, or some sort of food chain. Maple Leaf Foods I think it was... anyway, this equals BIG power for teachers, as they don't get pushed around like our teachers do. This equals BIG money for teachers. I think if reform doesn't come soon I will move to Canada, where I can teach and make good money, and any kids I have can have good teachers.

      I came up with an idea yesterday, when I saw a well-paid city worker standing around holding a "SLOW" sign.  Why are they paid $15.00 an hour to stand around holding a sign, instead of actually working?  My idea is this: Find beggars to take their place. clean them up, put on an orange vest, and give them a sign. Instead of saying "Will work for food," it will say "SLOW."   They will be paid good money, and they will be working, so it's a win-win situation for all parties! What do you think?

       Pit day!   Ugh... so people who know me know I accidentally stayed up until 1:00 AM CST, for my 7:00 AM CST wakeup call, and ended up working till 7:00 PM CST. Okay so I wasn't exactly working the entire time... I'm still a bit shaky loading rocks into a dump truck, though I'm perfectly okay digging and sorting with the skid loader (aka bobcat, tiny front-end loader...?) So anyway, eventually I will be able to load myself... it's not about ability, I can do it fine and have in the past, but one time loading for my dad the ground was too bumpy and I tipped and scraped the back of his truck and ever since then I've been kind of afraid. ANYWAY not like you care.     While out there I worked on my tan (gave my bald head some sun for the first time since I was a baby), and did some walking -- barefoot. Then while wading through the mud, I remembered that there are organisms that like to burrow through the bottom of your feet, and thought to myself... omg so like, am I gonna die from some microorganism now? That would TOTALLY suck.  But I am not really worried since I don't care.  Anyway, while walking I had a little bird nest pointed out to me in the middle of the rocks, and the eggs looked like rocks, and it was just in a little hole in the mud, and there was this baby bird there that appeared to be dead... but it wasn't... it was just playing dead because people were near. Its mother was about 10 yards away ruffling her feathers and screeching bloody murder to take our attention away from her nest. I thought that was sweet -- and very cool how nature works out like that.  Anyway, after eating one of the eggs (just kidding), I went for my walk, and found an egg shell maybe 30 yards away from the nest, in some fresh mud. Iiiiinteresting.  I also saw a pretty good-sized frog, with which I had a long staring contest.... but then I had to get back to work and scared it away :(  If anyone's traveling through Minnesota let me know and I'll try setting up a day at the pit... it's perfectly quiet and beautiful. Especially today, as it was 85 degrees, no clouds, a light breeze and NO HUMIDITY finally. Today was the most perfectest day ever.  That's why I'm in a good mood despite not sleeping much, and you know, having to work. O_o

Eerie.  Oh yeah, John was the one to cut it. God, I've never seen him as happy as he was to shave my head. o_O  Also, I learned that the little birthmark on the side of my head really isn't small at all, rather basically my head is purple except for a few patches of normal skin. That was an exaggeration. Basically, I've got a big birthmark on my head. O_o  Geeze, the girlz won't be attracted to me anymore.  AHAHAHAHAHAHA woooo hiya.

       Pit Duty   It was too hot today, thank God, because I had been picked up to work the pit, and I was on fire. The ramp to the tractor trailer dug into the blacktop because it was really soft. But it's after 3, and if I went to the pit I'd need to go in... under 4 hours. Hmmmm. I wonder if I can survive. It's not very long... but seriously, ever since I got heat stroke out there I've been SCAAAAARED.

       Speak and Spell   John pulled out his old Speak & Spell today and put batteries in it. I believe it's as old as I am, and still works fine. Did anyone else have one? These were definitely the coolest inventions ever. Especially back then; the technology was extremely advanced to have something so fun and interactive. Everyone should have one.   Shallow Hal   Eh, it was kinda funny, but I liked the message. I don't really want to talk about it because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but as far as the movie is concerned, it's... eh. All right. I don't exactly have any detailed critique of the movie, but Farrelly bros. films don't usually elicit much of a response from me.   Happy Fourth   I just dug out my old fireworks. Since Jesse "The Pig Fucker" Ventura legalized ground fireworks, I'm going to have some fun tomorrow. BBQ, then pyromania. It will be great. I have my 500 black cat string ready for the grand finale. That's gonna be one annoying motherfucking piece of work right there ;)

      Okay okay this isn't me taking pity on myself, I just want to ask a question: Has anyone ever convinced themselves to mentally ignore a pain mentally, but suffered from the physical byproducts of that stress? As in... I am trying my best to be happy, and acting happy, but I have had a stomach ache for days? O_o  I'm usually not like that. But then, I usually just shut down anyway so I guess I can deal.  I haven't been posting lately. You don't care anyway, because if you read this you probably talk to me off of the site... and if you don't, well, you just don't want to reply to anything, which is fine. I'm not a sweetie, I'm not gay, and I'm not a girl, so I am not attractive to reply to.  Elitist bastards. Where's the straight male asshole love in here!? I ask you WHERE?????

       urlLink Josh, Sam & Bel Playing in the Dirt   Okay I mislabeled this -- it's Josh (my favorite nephew), Samantha(my favorite niece) and Isabel (the favorite daughter of my favorite cousin), at my grandparents' house.  Josh is the boy, Sam is in pink and Bel is in the red dress. You can guess my gram and gramps.  This was earlier today, I went to work shoveling and hauling dirt in a wheelbarrow and they wouldn't let me. At one point I was buried up to my shins in dirt, those little tricksters.  I should have used bigger thumbnails, sorry folks. It's my first attempt at image publishing software.

        xXx   Here is something I posted on a message board, first regarding Vin Diesel as an actor, and second regarding the movie xXx itself.     First of all what's this whole "HE IS NOT THAT HOT AND CAN'T ACT" bullshit?  Arnold  Sylvester  :wtf:  Which those two won an oscar, or a "sexiest man alive" award?  Exactly! They had bodies. They could act like badasses. They're Vin Diesel. However, Vin imho looks better, is more "realistic" body-wise, has a cool voice AND a cool name, unlike his predecessors. Therefore, Vin superior, Arnold and Sly inferior.  As for the movie... I liked it. It was just an underachieving yet promising first attempt at an American James Bond (Wedge told me this wasn't the first, but I stated that the plot and a lot of the movie were direct ripoffs of Bond, making it more of a direct replica, not just an answer to Bond).  My problems with the film were first and very, very foremost the music. Cheesy and campy at times (if you felt the movie got a bit corny at times you were probably sucked into the music), and that was the score. The soundtrack -- the non-score songs -- were all misplaced. I could not feel any of the music in the film. They even had the corny "Bond-esque" music playing in real tense suspenseful moments, probably to create more levity, so that the crowd could have a "good time."  I think a good huge chunk of the stunts were far too over-the-top, such as the motorcycle(motorbike?) scenes, where he basically jumped off the ramp of a building and was what, 5 stories up in the air, with the fire right on his back without damaging him or even knocking him off course, and he landed seemlessly and kept driving. I started feeling like someone turned the no-grav cheat on in a video game.   Other than that, THIS WAS AN ACTION MOVIE! so you know, things like the convenience of a heat-seaking missile really weren't that ridiculous, considering how James Bond is a really shitty spy, since he always ALWAYS gets caught, and instead of escaping, most of the time people either let him live, or save him. Things like that remind me why action/spy movies are not supposed to be subjected to such rigorous scrutiny that people tend to use lately -- not just with these movies, but all movies. Every single movie is expected to make you think, yet it's the movies which try too hard to make you think and fail that are given the most applause. Pfffft.

      I have decided I can't have my blog being a place for self pity anymore. I do not like drama, and I should not partake in self pity. Pity is for the silly. While I will not slip into denial about me being a grade-a major loser, I'm deleting my whining posts from the last few days because, well, why the hell did I post them in the first place? I would like to say I am over my past but as you can see I obviously am not, and that is what makes me so lame.  So anyway.  urlLink Here  is a link to the stair-descent game, courtesy of Vy. It's very great. Let me know your high score. A warning from Vy: Don't try posting your high score online, it will crash your system.  I took pictures of how nasty parts of my room look before cleaning, and I've stalled midway through the cleaning process... but I will get it done before the month is through, oh yes I will! Or die trying! :( Does anyone want to help? I will pay.

       Fan Mail!   I got one of my first pieces of Fan Mail in my inbox tonight... and it states...     Subject: Came across your site thru blogsnob..  The background MIDI instantly turned me away...its cheesy and annoying.  At least give the option to turn it off.     My reply:    Hahahaha sorry about that... it's a little extra that I use to bug my viewers, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to  turn it off... 1) when the page loads, hit escape, or STOP on your browser. 2) Click on Comments, the music will stop. 3) Double click the little bell/horn icon in your system tray and turn off Synthesizer/MIDI, if you hate it so much.  Sorry to lose your business, you were a valued customer and I wish you luck in the future!  o_O  -Bean    I will be changing my MIDI soon, I've just been in the midst of a computer change, so ya know...

      The time... 9:00 AM  The breakfast... a dry toasted onion bagel.  All I have to say now, is this morning strikes me as painfully hard to swallow. O_o  I already finished my milk unfortunately, and now I am wasting time away until my bus comes in an hour and change.  I haven't had anything really to say the past while, which I'm sure has broken the hearts of one person: my imaginary internet stalker. That's right, I still want a stalker, so if you're interested in stalking me please drop me a line. Chances are you'll have a better chance of being chosen as my stalker if you're female, because I wouldn't be as flattered/scared if a guy did it.   Anywho my classes are annoying and so long that when I come back I am usually feeling noncreative, so...  Look at this, even now I wanted to post just to say something and it's totally just me mumbling, or scribbling, or whatever you want to call it.  Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo...  -Vikings suck -Blade II was good, but a bit too cartoony in places. -Charmed is a wonderful show. Too much clothing involved -I'm serious about the stalker thing. I'm lonely... so running away screaming from a nice girl would really brighten up my day. -Art scholars are PRETENTIOUS and I hate them. -So are most writers. Shall I become the first writer who isn't a chain smoker/alcoholic? -Geoffry Chaucer should have written in modern English, or at least in complete French so people would TRANSLATE HIM god damn it -Vikings suck -Cept Chris Hovan who will continue to rawk until he's in the Pro Bowl. -Oh and Moe Williams, who is way underutilized in the Vikings' "tire out the other team's offense by continually giving them the ball" scheme.  PS: What is with the phrase "out like a fat kid in dodge ball?" I am offended... I was a fat kid and I often won dodgeball. It's not about being fat, it's about being fat, slow and uncoordinated. I dodged as well as the skinny kids, and caught balls better than them.  Anyway, consider that me signing out... bye bye boyzzzzz and girlzzzzz

All I thought about was.... I would love to be a part of that. Any part of that. I'd sweep up, carry boxes, whatever... I just think it's all amazing.  I saw it on TV once, and I was not impressed... but I was given a ticket to see it tonight, and I was just so overwhelmed by the experience. This goes out specifically to Libby: It's nothing if not live. They have a live band, live singers...  I wouldn't mind seeing it again. I wanted to see Draleon last year but we never got the tickets, but whatever comes through next year I have got to see.  Wooooooooooo what an experience.   Anyway...
