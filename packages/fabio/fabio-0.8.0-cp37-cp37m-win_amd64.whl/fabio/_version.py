Module for version handling:

provides:
* version = "1.2.3" or "1.2.3-beta4"
* version_info = named tuple (1,2,3,"beta",4)
* hexversion: 0x010203B4
* strictversion = "1.2.3b4
* debianversion = "1.2.3~beta4"

This is called hexversion since it only really looks meaningful when viewed as the
result of passing it to the built-in hex() function.
The version_info value may be used for a more human-friendly encoding of the same information.

The hexversion is a 32-bit number with the following layout:
Bits (big endian order)     Meaning
1-8     PY_MAJOR_VERSION (the 2 in 2.1.0a3)
9-16     PY_MINOR_VERSION (the 1 in 2.1.0a3)
17-24     PY_MICRO_VERSION (the 0 in 2.1.0a3)
25-28     PY_RELEASE_LEVEL (0xA for alpha, 0xB for beta, 0xC for release candidate and 0xF for final)
29-32     PY_RELEASE_SERIAL (the 3 in 2.1.0a3, zero for final releases)

Thus 2.1.0a3 is hexversion 0x020100a3.
