js.angular_gettext
******************

Introduction
============

This library packages `angular-getttext`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`angular-gettext`: https://angular-gettext.rocketeer.be/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.angular_gettext``) are published to some URL.
