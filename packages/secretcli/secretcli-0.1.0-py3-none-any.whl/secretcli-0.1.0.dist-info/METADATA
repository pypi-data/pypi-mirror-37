secretcli
=========

The secretcli project provides a simple to use command line interface to
the `AWS Secrets Manager <https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/>`__.
It is capable of uploading or downloading the entire secret as well as
working with individual fields.

Usage
-----

Initializing a new Secret
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New secrets are easy to initiate. This will create a new Secret in the
AWS Secret Manager and store an empty javascript object as the first
version.

.. code:: bash

   $ secretscli init TestSecret

Working with individual Keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Additional Key/Value pairs can be added to the secret using a single
command. Behind the scenes this downloads the existing database, updates
it with the new key/value pair, and uploads it as the current version.

.. code:: bash

   $ secretscli set TestSecret postgreshost 10.10.10.16
   $ secretscli set TestSecret postgresuser postgres
   $ secretscli set TestSecret postgrespassword super_secret_string
   $ secretscli set TestSecret longstring "This is a string with spaces."

Retrieving values is just as simple. This can be useful when trying to
use values in bash scripts.

.. code:: bash

   $ secretscli get TestSecret postgreshost
   10.10.10.16
   $ secretscli get TestSecret postgresuser
   postgres
   $ secretscli get TestSecret postgrespassword
   super_secret_string

Values can also be completely removed from the secret.

.. code:: bash

   $ secretscli get TestSecret postgreshost
   10.10.10.16
   $ secretscli remove TestSecret postgreshost
   $ secretscli get TestSecret postgreshost

Working with entire Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire Secret can be downloaded as a file. This command works
regardless of the format of the file- Secrets that are not managed by
``secretcli`` can be downloaded using this tool.

.. code:: bash

   $ secretscli download TestSecret ./secret_configuration.json

The file can also be uploaded- but be careful, it will be uploaded
exactly as is without any verification of the json formatting.

.. code:: bash

   $ secretscli upload TestSecret ./secret_configuration.json

Datastore Format
----------------

``secretcli`` stores data as a json object. It uses the ``SecretString``
field in the AWS Secrets Manager- saving it as a string allows the
database to be viewed in the AWS Console.
