Description: # bookman
        
        bookman is a non-webapp, standalone bookmark managing software. It gives you the ability to store any link you want and open it instantly.
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        * Python 3
        * Python 3 - GTK3
        * Python 3 - Yaml
        * Python 3 - SQL Alchemy
        
        ## Building packages
        
        To build bookman you will need:
        * A private GPG-Key
        * Make
        * Python 3
        * [stdeb](https://pypi.org/project/stdeb/)
        
        ### Building for Debian
        
        ```bash
        make deb
        ```
        
        ### Building for Fedora/Redhat
        
        ```bash
        make rpm
        ```
        
        The package created stores everything under /usr/local. Therefore you might add
        following to your ~/.bashrc file to actually use bookman:
        
        ```bash
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages
        ```
