-W- Basemap is installed but could not be imported.
    You are probably missing a required environment variable
    To use basemap, you will need to run this program or notebook in a conda env.
    For more on how to create a conda env, see: https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
    Or, you could just skip using Basemap (for now -- we are working on making this easier)
