## Dependencies for (K/X)Ubuntu 18.04 or newer
```bash
sudo apt install gir1.2-gtksource-3.0 gir1.2-appindicator3-0.1 python3-gi-cairo python3-pip
```

## Install using PIP
```bash
pip3 install gkraken
```
Add the the executable path `~/.local/bin` to your PATH variable if missing.

## Update using PIP
```bash
pip3 install -U gkraken
```

## Running the app
To start the app you have to run the command `gkraken` in a terminal. The app needs to access the USB interface of the Kranen that, normally,
is not available to unprivileged users. 

To allow normal users to access the Kraken's USB interface you can 
create a custom udev rule

### Udev rule
#### Automatic way
Once GKraken is installed, the udev rule can be easily crated executing
```bash
sudo `which gkraken` --udev-add-rule
```

#### Manual way
If for some reason the automatic way fails, you can always do if manually creating a new 
file in `/lib/udev/rules.d/60-gkraken.rules` containing this text:
```bash
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1e71", ATTRS{idProduct}=="170e", MODE="0666"
```

After that, run the following commands
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --subsystem-match=usb --attr-match=idVendor=1e71 --action=add
```

If you don't want to create this custom rule you can run gkraken as root 
(using sudo) but we advise against this solution.

## Command line options

  |-m, --minimized            |Start minimized to the notification area
  |--udev-add-rule            |Add udev rule to allow execution without root permission|
  |--udev-remove-rule         |Remove udev rule that allow execution without root permission|
