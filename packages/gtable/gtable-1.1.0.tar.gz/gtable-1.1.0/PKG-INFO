Description: Gtable
        ======
        
        Gtable is a container for tabular or tabular-like data designed with speed in
        mind. It tries to improve one some aspects of
        using pandas data types Series and DataFrame as containers for simple
        computations:
        
        * It Reduces the overhead for column access, creation, and concatenation.
        
        * It supports sparse data with bitmap indexing.
        
        * It truly handles NaNs, making a difference between a NaN and a NA in its
          internal representation.
        
        * It provides fast transformations (filling NA values, filtering, joining...)
        
        It also relies heavily on `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_. You can consider
        gtable as a thin layer over numpy arrays.
        
        You can install gtable with a simple ``pip install gtable``.
        Gtable is an open-source project released under a BSD 3-Clause license. You
        can read the full documentation
