class Subdomain(Base):
    r"""
    This subclass of the Base class provides the ability assign the object
    to specific locations (pores and throats) in the domain.  This class
    is subclassed by GenericGeometry and GenericPhysics.

    Notes
    -----
    The following table list the two methods added to Base by this subclass.

    +---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
    | Methods             | Description                                       |
    +=====================+===================================================+
    | ``add_locations``   | Specified which pores and throats the object      |
    |                     | should be assigned to                             |
    +---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
    | ``drop_locations``  | Removes the object from the specified pores and   |
    |                     | throats                                           |
    +---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
    | ``_get_boss``       | Geomtry and Physics objects are subservient to    |
    |                     | Network and Phase objects, respectively, so this  |
    |                     | method returns a handle to the appropriate *boss* |
    +---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

    Also listed above is a hidden method that might be useful.  The act of
    assign a Subdomain object to a subset of pores or throats basically amounts
    to creating a list in the *boss* object with the Subdomain's name, like
    ``'pore.geo_1'``, with True values where ``geo_1`` applies and False
    elsewhere.  Changing the locations of objects is just a matter of changing
    the locations of the True's and False's.

    The Project object has two methods, ``check_geometry_health`` and
    ``check_physics_health`` that look to make sure all locations are assigned
    to one and only one Geometry and/or Physics.

    def add_locations(self, pores=[], throats=[]):
        r"""
        Adds associations between an object and its boss object at the
        given pore and/or throat locations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pores and throats : array_like
            The pore and/or throat locations for which the association should
            be added.  These indices are for the full domain.

        Notes
        -----
        For *Physics* objects, the boss is the *Phase* with which it was
        assigned, while for *Geometry* objects the boss is the *Network*.

    def drop_locations(self, pores=[], throats=[], complete=False):
        r"""
        Removes association between an objectx and its boss object at the
        given pore and/or throat locations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pores and throats : array_like
            The pore and/or throat locations from which the association should
            be removed.  These indices refer to the full domain.

        complete : boolean (default is ``False``)
            If ``True`` then *all* pore and throat associations are removed
            along with any trace that the objects were associated.

        Notes
        -----
        For *Physics* objects, the boss is the *Phase* with which it was
        assigned, while for *Geometry* objects the boss is the *Network*.
