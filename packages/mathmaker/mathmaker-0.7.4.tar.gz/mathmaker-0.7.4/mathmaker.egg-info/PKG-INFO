        Overview
        ========
        
        Mathmaker creates elementary maths worksheets with detailed solutions.
        
        The output documents can be compiled into pdf files by lualatex.
        Examples of available themes are: first degree equations, pythagorean
        theorem, fractions calculation...
        
        It can run from command line, but can be controlled via http requests
        too.

        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        Complete install
        ----------------
        
        .. note::
        
          python3.6+ is mandatory for mathmaker to work, so check is installed on your system
        
        -  on Ubuntu 14.04 or later:
        
           External dependencies:
        
           ::
        
               $ sudo apt-get install eukleides libxml2-utils gettext texlive-full
        
           Note: to avoid installing ``texlive-full``, check the
           `documentation <http://mathmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_doc.html#install>`__.
        
           Then:
        
           ::
        
               $ pip3 install mathmaker
        
        -  on FreeBSD 10.\*:
        
           External dependencies:
        
           ::
        
               $ sudo pkg install python36 py36-sqlite3 gettext eukleides libxml2 texlive-full
               $ rehash
        
               **note**
        
               Because of a bug in current FreeBSD's eukleides package you'll
               have to fix eukleides install. See
               `here <http://mathmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_doc.html#eukleides-fix>`__.
        
           Once you're done, you can proceed installing mathmaker:
        
           ::
        
               $ pip3 install mathmaker
        
               **note**
        
               If you stumble upon an error during the install of the
               python-daemon dependency, you'll find the way to solve it
               `there <http://mathmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_doc.html#python-daemon-error-at-install>`__
        
        Basic use
        ---------
        
        ::
        
            $ mathmaker pythagorean-theorem-short-test > out.tex
            $ lualatex out.tex
        
        or directly:
        
        ::
        
            $ mathmaker pythagorean-theorem-short-test --pdf > out.pdf
        
        Get the list of all provided sheets(3):
        
        ::
        
            $ mathmaker list
        
        To get the command-line options, you can use ``mathmaker --help``.
        
        Several settings can be overriden by user defined values in
        ``~/.config/mathmaker/user_config.yaml``. Read `the complete
        documentation <http://mathmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_doc.html#user-settings>`__
        for more information.
        
        Advanced use
        ------------
        
        It's possible to create your own sheets in yaml. Read from `the complete
        documentation <http://mathmaker.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_doc.html#yaml-sheets>`__
        for more information.
        
        Contribute
        ==========
        
        You can contribute to mathmaker:
        
        As a wordings contributor
        -------------------------
        
        Mathmaker needs contexts for problems wordings. There are already some,
        but the more there is, the better. Existing wordings can be found
        `here <https://gitlab.com/nicolas.hainaux/mathmaker/tree/dev/mathmaker/data/wordings>`__.
        You can submit any new idea as an enhancement proposal
        `there <https://gitlab.com/nicolas.hainaux/mathmaker/issues>`__ (should
        be written in english, french or german).
        
        Any question can be sent to nh dot techn (hosted at gmail dot com).
        
        As a translator
        ---------------
        
        You can help translating mathmaker to your language (or any language you
        like, if you have enough elementary maths vocabulary for that).
        
        If the translation to your language isn't started yet, there are several
        pot files to get
        `here <https://gitlab.com/nicolas.hainaux/mathmaker/tree/dev/mathmaker/locale>`__
        (see explanations about their respective roles
        `there <http://mathmaker.readthedocs.io/en/dev/dev_doc.html#the-real-and-the-fake-translation-files>`__).
        You can use an editor like `poedit <https://poedit.net/>`__ or any other
        you like better, to create po files from them and start to translate.
        
        If you want to add missing translations, or to correct some, you can
        find the po files in the subdirectories
        `here <https://gitlab.com/nicolas.hainaux/mathmaker/tree/dev/mathmaker/locale>`__.
        
        Once you're done, you can make a pull request
        `here <https://gitlab.com/nicolas.hainaux/mathmaker/pulls>`__.
        
        Any question can be sent to nh dot techn (hosted at gmail dot com).
        
        As a developer
        --------------
        
        Before submitting a PR, please ensure you've had a look at the `writing
        rules <http://mathmaker.readthedocs.io/en/dev/dev_doc.html#writing-rules>`__.

        ---------------------------------
        
        * Add mental calculation sheets for fifth level ("yellow belt, 2d stripe")
        * Add mental calculation sheets for sixth level ("orange belt")
        * Automatically adapt LaTeX preamble, depending on packages really required to compile the document
        * mathmaker project moves to gitlab.com
        
        New in version 0.7.3 (2018-01-15)

        * Add mental calculation sheets for third level ("yellow belt")
        * The mental calculation pdf may now be "interactive" (answers can be written in text fields, they can be validated pushing a button; this validation is done by some javascript)
        * The daemon now accepts an optional argument in the request (written right after sheet's name, separated with a '|'. Only interactive is allowed, so far)
        
        New in version 0.7.1-3 (2017-08-30)
        -----------------------------------

        * New sheet: order of precedence in operations.
        * YAML files will be used to store sheets. The previous ways (XML and Python) will be dropped.
        * Huge reorganization of the lib/ source code.
        * Fair bunch of bug fixes.
        * Issue warnings instead of exceptions when the version of a dependency could not be determined. [0.7.1dev5 (2017-05-04)]
        * New sheets about trigonometry: [0.7.1dev4 (2017-05-03)]

          - intercept theorem: write the correct quotients' equalities
          - intercept theorem: solve simple exercises
        
        * A new sheet (declined in two versions): expansion of double brackets. Defined in an xml sheet as for mental calculation sheets. [0.7.1dev1 (2016-09-14)]
        
        New in version 0.7.0-6 (2016-08-19)
        -----------------------------------
        
        * Added a setting to let the user change mathmaker's path (to be used by the daemon)
        * Bugfix [0.7.0-5 (2016-08-19)]
        * If an IP address is passed as parameter to mathmaker's daemon, it will return a 429 http status code (too many requests) if the last request from the same address is not older than 10 seconds. [0.7.0-4 (2016-08-19)]
        * Fixed the install of locale files and font listing file [0.7.0-3 (2016-07-18)]

        -------------------------------
        
        * Standardized structure (``mathmaker`` becomes pip3-installable, available on PyPI and github; its documentation is hosted on readthedocs; tests are made with py.test)
        * A daemon is added (``mathmakerd``) to provide communication with ``mathmaker`` through http connections.
        * A bunch of mental calculation sheets
        * The use of XML frameworks for the sheets (yet only for mental calculation, so far)
