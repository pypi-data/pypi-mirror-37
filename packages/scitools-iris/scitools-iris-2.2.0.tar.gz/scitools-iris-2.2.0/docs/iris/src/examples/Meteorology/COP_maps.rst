Global average annual temperature maps
======================================

Produces maps of global temperature forecasts from the A1B and E1 scenarios.

The data used comes from the HadGEM2-AO model simulations for the A1B and E1
scenarios, both of which were derived using the IMAGE Integrated Assessment
Model (Johns et al. 2010; Lowe et al. 2009).
