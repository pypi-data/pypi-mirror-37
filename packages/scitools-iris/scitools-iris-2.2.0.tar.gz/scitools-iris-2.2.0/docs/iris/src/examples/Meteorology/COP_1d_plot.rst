.. _Meteorology-COP_1d_plot:


Global average annual temperature plot
======================================

Produces a time-series plot of North American temperature forecasts for 2
different emission scenarios. Constraining data to a limited spatial area also
features in this example.

The data used comes from the HadGEM2-AO model simulations for the A1B and E1
scenarios, both of which were derived using the IMAGE Integrated Assessment
Model (Johns et al. 2010; Lowe et al. 2009).
