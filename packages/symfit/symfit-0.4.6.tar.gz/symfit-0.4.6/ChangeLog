* Throws an Error if you try to add weights to LikeLihood fits
* Added example of calling a minimizer directly
* Docs describing the new structure
* Added a covariance matrix to Likelihood fitting
* Fixed ScipyMinize's identity crisis. It's now a definitive mix-in class
* No scipy for 3.7-dev, so not worth all the errors
* Add 3.7-dev to travis
* Made pytest.ini to ignore RuntimeWarnings and UserWarnings
* Fixed Py2 errors. You want to check the docstring
* Fixed Sphinx build error
* Added a docstring to Models eval\_jac
* Fixed broken links in the docs
* Made existing documentation compatible with new structure
* Cleared sphynx indentattion warning
* py2 new-style classes
* py2 compatible kwarg function calls
* Fixed compatibility with newer numpys stricter (better) indexing rules
* py2 dict initiation
* py2 keywordonly decorator
* Removed fancy dict initialisation
* Processed pckroon's comments, cleanup
* Removed leftover print statements
* Added basic tests for Minimizers
* Minimizers now return FitResults
* Moved FitResults to a seperate file
* Now using wrapped\_jacobian for consistency
* Added comments and docstrings to some Minimizers
* Added negation as the way to maximize
* Added Constraint objects to the public API
* Initial Commit of new Fit
* Updated docstring to reflex changes to FitResults
* Stdevs can be None again
* In tests comparing Maximize to scipys equivalent, we should still use SLSQP
* Updated tests for bounds
* Force max >= min for fixed params
* Force max >= min
* SLSQP is no longer the default of Minimize. This caused more problems than it solved
* Constraint object work with all models now

0.3.7
-----

* Switched back to last known working sphynx
* Added a space
* Use the reference
* Fixed #123. Use np.array type if no array operations are supported on the provided data
* Fixed #120. Only dividing by the overal chi once in the last step and then replacing nan by zero does the trick
* Removed some old commented debugging lines
* fixed fit by specifying seed for gaussian

0.3.6
-----

* Updated two tests to reflect that stdevs can be None by default if they are not computed
* Pragmatic fix of #116. Should be improved by giving ODEModels a numerical\_jacobian some day
* Added/extended some comments
* Did it properly now. Locally tests passed, making debugging challenging..
* Implemented sigma \*= np.ones(N). Fixes #109
* Changed my github username. Reflecting that change here
* Changed the dependancy of travis to matplotlib rather than mpl2.0rc2
* Changed FitResults to be more flexible wrt GoF qualifiers
* Now that #45 was fixed, this line could be made a lot cleaner
* FitResults are now initiated with a model, not just the list of Parameters. This feels more consistent
* Fixed a bug in README and fixed a typo
* Fixed #57, ParameterDict has been destroyed, so it no longer has an identity crisis. It has been replaced with an OrderedDict. However, Pitje06's point in #45 is now even more evident; confusion between the content of FitResults.params and Model.params is bound to arrise
* Removed read-only proporties from FitResults all together
* Removed \_\_ elsewhere where it wasn't strictly needed
* Fixes #91, removed the private parts from FitResults
* Fixed a minor mistake in the docs with header types
* Updated the examples to reflect the API update
* Adapted the tests to be compatible with the API update
* Changed no\_show to show to get rid of double negations, and introduced .execute to make the API consistant with the project
* Install matplotlib 2.0.0rc2 for all py versions
* Install matplotlib 2.0.0rc2 for py3.6
* Include installation instructions for the dependencies of contrib
* Made InteractiveGuess2D objects printable
* Add py3.6 to the travis build
* Fixed an issue with the dimensionaly of the Dfun argument to odeint
* Removed constraint\_type as a class attribute since it wasn't needed and caused the docs to panic
* Added leastsqbound to the list of things to ignore, since it uses a different style of docstrings then we do (numpy?)
* Enabled nitpick ignore for some packages
* Updated some docstring that triggered warnings
* Updated the bash command to a conditional code block for py3.5
* Fixed keywordonly in inheritance scenarios. Now survices all tests
* Added inheritance tests for keywordonly
* Updated keywordonly such that all tests for it work in py2. However, all other tests fail
* Added tests for the keywordonly decorator
* Fixed #99. Now only Eq, Le and Ge constraints are allowed
* Seperated tests for Minimize from test\_general
* Fixed duplicate target name warning
* Made splitting over multiple lines in occordance with PEP8 and the Hitchhikers guide to Python (aka the bible)
* Made sure tuple unpacking is always presented as the first choice
* Some minor corrections to the style guide
* Updated to version 0.3.5. 0.3.4 was skipped because PyPI is unforgiving to the correction of mistakes, but rightfully so. See pypa/packaging-problems, #74
* Fix #95
* Still trying to fix #95

0.3.5
-----

* Fixed FutureWarning for comparing with None
* Added myself to AUTHORS
* Moved specific py2 dependancy to requirements.txt with an environment marker
* Added setuptools to pip install -U, to make pbs happy
* Link Fit.model to Fit.fit.model
* Added more tests of auto fit, as well as the same checks for ConstrainedNumericalLeastSquares and NumericalLeastSquares seperately
* Made minor changes to tests to switch to the use of either Fit, or to manually select a type
* Model.shared\_parameters to check if parameters are shared between vector components
* Define the new smart Fit object
* Added matplotlib and seaborn to travis again, since the tests are still broken in this branch
* Changed .travis.yml to use pip instead of conda
