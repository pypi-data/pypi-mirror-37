Description: # pastepwn - Paste-Scraping Python Framework
        
        [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com) is a very helpful tool to store or rather share ascii encoded data online. In the world of OSINT, pastebin is being used by [researchers all around the world](https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-paste-searches-and/) to retreive e.g. leaked account data, in order to find indicators about security breaches.
        
        *Pastepwn* is a framework to scrape pastes and scan them for certain indicators. There are several analyzers and actions to be used out-of-the-box, but it is also easily extensible - you can create your own analyzers and actions on the fly.
        
        **Please note:** This framework is **not** to be used for illegal actions. It can be used for querying public Pastebin pastes for e.g. your username or email address in order to increase your own security.
        
        ### Setup pastepwn
        
        To use the pastepwn framework you need to follow these simple steps:
        
        1) **Make sure** to have a [Pastebin premium](https://pastebin.com/pro) account!
        2) Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/pastepwn.git`
        3) Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`¹
        4) Create a file (e.g. `main.py`) in the project root, where you put your code in²
        5) Fill that file with content - add analyzers and actions. Check the [example](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/pastepwn/tree/master/examples/example.py) implementation.
        
        ¹ *(There will be a pypi module for installation with pip soon)*
        
        ² *(If you want to store all pastes, make sure to setup a `mongodb` instance)*
        
        ### Behind a proxy
        
        There is 2 ways to use this tool behind a proxy:
        
        * Define the following environment variables: `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY`.
        * When initializing the PastePwn object, use the `proxies` argument. `proxies` is a dict as defined in [requests' documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies).
        
        ### ToDos
        There are quite some features which will be implemented in the (near) future.
        Check the [bug tracker](https://github.com/d-Rickyy-b/pastepwn/issues) on GitHub to get an up-to-date status about features and ToDos.
        
        - REST API for querying paste data
        - Adding more analyzers and actions, based on community input
        - Adding support for other paste sites
        - Add a helpful wiki with instructions and examples
