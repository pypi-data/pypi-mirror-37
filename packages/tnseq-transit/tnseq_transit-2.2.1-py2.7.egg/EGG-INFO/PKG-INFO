        Welcome! This is the distribution for the TRANSIT and TPP tools developed by the Ioerger Lab.
        
        TRANSIT is a tool for the analysis of Tn-Seq data. It provides an easy to use graphical interface and access to three different analysis methods that allow the user to determine essentiality in a single condition as well as between conditions.
        
        
        ## Features
        TRANSIT offers a variety of features including:
            
        -   More than **8 analysis methods**, including methods for determining **conditional essentiality** as well as **genetic interactions**.
        
        -   Ability to analyze datasets from libraries constructed using  **himar1 or tn5 transposons**.
        
        -   **TrackView** to help visualize read-counts accross the genome.
        
        -   Can **export datasets** into a variety of formats, including **IGV**.
        
        -   Includes a **variety of normalization methods**.
        
        -   **Quality Control** diagnostics, to idenfity poor quality datasets.
        
        -   Ability to install as a **python package**, to import and use in your own personal scripts.
