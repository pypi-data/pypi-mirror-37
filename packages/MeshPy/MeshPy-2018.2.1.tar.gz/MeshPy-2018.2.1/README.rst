MeshPy offers quality triangular and tetrahedral mesh generation for Python.
Meshes of this type are chiefly used in finite-element simulation codes, but
also have many other applications ranging from computer graphics to robotics.

In order to generate 2D and 3D meshes, MeshPy provides Python interfaces to
three well-regarded mesh generators, `Triangle

<http://tetgen.berlios.de/>`_ by Hang Si
The former two are included in the package in slightly modified versions. A
generic mesh reader for the latter is included, as is an easy way to run `gmsh`
from a Python script.

For an interface to `gmsh

see `gmsh_interop <https://github.com/inducer/gmsh_interop>`.

MeshPy has no dependencies other than a C++ compiler and a working Python installation.

As of Version 0.91.2, MeshPy also works with Python 3.
