This is a guide on creating a splash screen picture using the GIMP template.

**Location**
The template file is located in `source/rafcon/gui/assets/themes/templates`. The standard place for
images to be loaded into the startup splashscreen is `source/rafcon/gui/assets/splashscreens`.

**File**
The template is a `.xcf` which is the native project format of GIMP. This guide is also using GIMP.

**Process**

1. Open the template with GIMP.

2. First select single window mode: ``Windows -> Single Window Mode``. This will save you a lot of time and struggle.

3. Check if the Layer widget is present. It should contain five items, one layer ``Background`` and four ``RAFCON_logo`` layers. If not present, press ``Ctrl + L``.

4. Now go to ``File -> Open as Layers`` and select a picture of your choice.

5. Check if the image is placed between ``Background`` and ``RAFCON_Logo`` in the Layer widget. If not, drag it in the correct position.

6. Now select the layer with your picture in the Layer widget.

   - Go to the Tools widget and select the ``Scale`` tool.
   - Click on your picture with the ``Scale`` tool and fit it in the 570x320px field.
   - If your not satisfied with your result, try the "Move" tool and move the layer around.

7. Notice the small eye in the Layer widget next to a layer? Activate the visibility of a logo that serves your needs the best.

8. If everything is done, ignore the invisible layers and click on ``File -> Export As``. Export the picture as whatever python is able to load into a pixelbuffer, .jpg and .png work fine.

9. Voila, there is your normed splash screen!
