0.7.0
"""""

This is a big minor release including many changes. State machines stored with version 0.6.\* are compatible with this version, but not state machines from older releases. Those have to be opened with 0.6.\* and then saved again. The following list is probably not complete:

- Support for openSUSE Leap
- Support for plugins
- Major design overhaul: agrees with drafts from design and looks consistent on all platforms
- Drag and Drop of states

  - Libraries from the library tree
  - Any type of state from the buttons below the graphical state editor
  - The drop position determines the location and the parent of the
    new state

- All sidebars can now be undocked and moved to another screen
- Auto store state machine in background and recover after crash
- Improved history with branches
- New feature: run until state
- Extended stepping mode: step into, over and out
- Redesign remote execution of state machines: Native GUI can be used to execute state machine running on different host
- Drop support of YAML state machine files
- Rename state machine files
- Extend documentation
- RMC-BuildBot support
- Many bug fixes
- A lot of refactorings, code optimizations, etc.

fix start from selected state (the start-from-selected-state functionality modifies the start state of a hierarchy state on the initial execution of the statemachine; the start state was accidentally modified for each execution of the hierarchy state during one run leading to wrong execution of hierarchy states that were executed more often during the execution of a statemachine)
