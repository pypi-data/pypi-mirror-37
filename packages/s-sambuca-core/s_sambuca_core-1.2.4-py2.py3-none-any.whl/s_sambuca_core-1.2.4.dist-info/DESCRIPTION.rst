Development
-----------

There is a makefile in the project root with targets for the most common
development operations such as lint checks, running unit tests, building the
documentation, and building installing packages.

`Bumpversion <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bumpversion>`_ is used to manage the
package version numbers. This ensures that the version number is correctly
incremented in all required files. Please see the bumpversion documentation for
usage instructions, and do not edit the version strings directly.
