pyATS Kleenex Component
=======================

pyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and 
reusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development 
iterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers start with small, 
simple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous 
test suites.

pyATS is initially developed internally in Cisco, and is now available to the
general public starting late 2017 through `Cisco DevNet`_. Visit the pyATS

are not yet supported.

Quick Start
