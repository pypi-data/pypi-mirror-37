Description: =====
        CName
        =====
        
        ``CName`` is a plugin for `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_,
        a static site generator written in Python.
        
        ``CName`` creates a *CNAME* file in the root of your output directory. This
        is useful when you are publishing your site to
        `GitHub Pages <https://pages.github.com/>`_ on a
        `custom domain <https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/>`_.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The easiest way to install ``CName`` is through the use of pip. This
        will also install the required dependencies automatically.
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
          pip install minchin.pelican.plugins.cname
        
        Then, in your ``pelicanconf.py`` file, add ``CName`` to your list of
        plugins:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          PLUGINS = [
                      # ...
                      'minchin.pelican.plugins.cname',
                      # ...
                    ]
        
        And that's it! No further configuration is needed.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        No configuration is needed. The value places in the *CNAME* files is based
        on your ``SITEURL`` setting.
