Description: cfncluster is an example framework for launching clusters.
        
            usage: cfncluster [-h]
                              {create,update,delete,start,stop,status,list,instances,ssh,configure,version}
                              ...
        
            cfncluster is a tool to launch and manage a cluster.
        
            positional arguments:
              {create,update,delete,start,stop,status,list,instances,ssh,configure,version}
                create              creates a cluster
                update              update a running cluster
                delete              delete a cluster
                start               start the compute fleet that has been stopped
                stop                stop the compute fleet, but leave the master server
                                    running for debugging/development
                status              pull the current status of the cluster
                list                display a list of stacks associated with cfncluster
                instances           display a list of all instances in a cluster
                ssh                 connect to the master server using SSH
                configure           creating initial cfncluster configuration
                version             display version of cfncluster
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
