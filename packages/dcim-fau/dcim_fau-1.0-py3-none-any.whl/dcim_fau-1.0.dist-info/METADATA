About
-------------

DCIM_fau is a Python program designed to simplify deploying and monitoring large SNMP-based networking interfaces.



Getting Started 
----
DCIM_fau is quick to deploy and even quicker to run.

#### 1. Installation
Firstly, pull the package from either PyPi or Github:

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `$ pip install dcim_fau` &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _installation via pip package manager is **always** preferred_

#### 2. _conf.yaml_
The configuration file for DCIM_fau uses markdown to notate specific parameters required to run in a readable format.

 ##### &nbsp; &nbsp; _conf.yaml_ example
```YAML    
  snmp:
    - COMM_STRING: 'mySNMPsecret'

  chron:
   # collection interval (seconds)
   - COLL_INTERVAL: 120

# MYSQL connection info
  db:
    - DB_HOST: 'localhost'
    - DB_USER: 'root'
    - DB_PASSWORD: 'admin'
    - DB_NAME: 'deebee'
```

 &nbsp; &nbsp; You **must** include your _conf.yaml_ in your DCIM_fau root directory, with all parameters validated.

#### 3. Initialize and Run
##### Initialization:

DCIM_fau utilizes Python's `console_scripts` entry point logic to simplify deployment and execution.

To initialize, run the following command:

`$ scaffold`

This scaffolds the database, building the necessary structure for the provided equipment OIDs.

##### Run:
To start collection, run the following command:

`$ run`
