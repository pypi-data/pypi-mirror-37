        This is yt_astro_analysis, the [yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt) extension
        package for astrophysical analysis.  This is primarily machinery that used to be
        in yt's analysis_modules.  These were made into a separate package to allow yt to
        become less astro-specifc and to allow these modules to be developed on their own
        schedule.
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install yt_astro_analysis, you will first need to 
        [install yt](https://github.com/yt-project/yt#installation).  Then, clone the
        git repository and install like this:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/yt-project/yt_astro_analysis
        cd yt_astro_analysis
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ### Installing with Rockstar support
        
        In order to run the Rockstar halo finder from within yt_astro_analysis, you will
        need to install the
        [yt-project's fork of Rockstar](https://github.com/yt-project/rockstar) and then
        provide this path to yt_astro_analysis.  To install Rockstar, do the following:
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/yt-project/rockstar
        cd rockstar
        make lib
        ```
        
        Then, go into the yt_astro_analysis source directory and add a file called
        "rockstar.cfg" with the path the Rockstar repo you just cloned.  Then, install
        yt_astro_analysis.
        
        ```
        cd yt_astro_analysis
        echo <path_to_rockstar> > rockstar.cfg
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        Finally, you'll need to make sure that the location of ``librockstar.so`` is in
        your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
        
        ```
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_rockstar>
        ```
        
        ## Importing from yt_astro_analysis
        
        For every module that was moved from yt's analysis_modules to yt_astro_analysis,
        all imports can be changed simply by substituting ``yt.analysis_modules`` with
        ``yt.extensions.astro_analysis``.  For example, the following
        
        ```
        from yt.analysis_modules.ppv_cube.api import PPVCube
        ```
        becomes
        ```
        from yt.extensions.astro_analysis.ppv_cube.api import PPVCube
        ```
        
        ## Contributing
        
        We really want your contributions!  As an official
        [yt-project](http://yt-project.org/) extension, everything in the
        [yt Contributor Guide](https://github.com/yt-project/yt#contributing) applies
        here.
        
        If you'd rather make your own standalone package, we want to support that, too!
        Please, consider making your package a
        [yt extension](http://yt-project.org/extensions.html).
        
        ## Resources
        
        As an extension of the [yt-project](http://yt-project.org/), the
        [yt resources](https://github.com/yt-project/yt#resources) are available for help.
