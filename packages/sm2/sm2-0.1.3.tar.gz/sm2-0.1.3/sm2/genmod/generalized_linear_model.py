    Parameters
    ----------
    endog : array-like
        1d array of endogenous response variable.  This array can be 1d or 2d.
        Binomial family models accept a 2d array with two columns. If
        supplied, each observation is expected to be [success, failure].
    exog : array-like
        A nobs x k array where `nobs` is the number of observations and `k`
        is the number of regressors. An intercept is not included by default
        and should be added by the user (models specified using a formula
        include an intercept by default). See `sm2.tools.add_constant`.
    family : family class instance
        The default is Gaussian.  To specify the binomial distribution
        family = sm.family.Binomial()
        Each family can take a link instance as an argument.  See
        sm2.family.family for more information.
    offset : array-like or None
        An offset to be included in the model.  If provided, must be
        an array whose length is the number of rows in exog.
    exposure : array-like or None
        Log(exposure) will be added to the linear prediction in the model.
        Exposure is only valid if the log link is used. If provided, it must be
        an array with the same length as endog.
    freq_weights : array-like
        1d array of frequency weights. The default is None. If None is selected
        or a blank value, then the algorithm will replace with an array of 1's
        with length equal to the endog.
        WARNING: Using weights is not verified yet for all possible options
        and results, see Notes.
    var_weights : array-like
        1d array of variance (analytic) weights. The default is None. If None
        is selected or a blank value, then the algorithm will replace with an
        array of 1's with length equal to the endog.
        WARNING: Using weights is not verified yet for all possible options
        and results, see Notes.

     ============= ===== === ===== ====== ======= === ==== ====== ====== ====

    Not all of these link functions are currently available.

    Endog and exog are references so that if the data they refer to are already
    arrays and these arrays are changed, endog and exog will change.

    Statsmodels supports two separte definitions of weights: frequency weights
    and variance weights.

    Frequency weights produce the same results as repeating observations by the
    frequencies (if those are integers). Frequency weights will keep the number
    of observations consistent, but the degrees of freedom will change to
    reflect the new weights.

    Variance weights (referred to in other packages as analytic weights) are
    used when ``endog`` represents an an average or mean. This relies on the
    assumption that that the inverse variance scales proportionally to the
    weight--an observation that is deemed more credible should have less
    variance and therefore have more weight. For the ``Poisson`` family--which
    assumes that occurences scale proportionally with time--a natural practice
    would be to use the amount of time as the variance weight and set ``endog``
    to be a rate (occurrances per period of time). Similarly, using a
    compound Poisson family, namely ``Tweedie``, makes a similar assumption
    about the rate (or frequency) of occurences having variance proportional to
    time.

    Both frequency and variance weights are verified for all basic results with
    nonrobust or heteroscedasticity robust ``cov_type``. Other robust
    covariance types have not yet been verified, and at least the small sample
    correction is currently not based on the correct total frequency count.

    Currently, all residuals are not weighted by frequency, although they may
    incorporate ``n_trials`` for ``Binomial`` and ``var_weights``

    +---------------+----------------------------------+
    | Residual Type | Applicable weights               |
    +===============+==================================+
    | Anscombe      | ``var_weights``                  |
    +---------------+----------------------------------+
    | Deviance      | ``var_weights``                  |

    WARNING: Loglikelihood and deviance are not valid in models where
    scale is equal to 1 (i.e., ``Binomial``, ``NegativeBinomial``, and
    ``Poisson``). If variance weights are specified, then results such as
    ``loglike`` and ``deviance`` are based on a quasi-likelihood
    interpretation. The loglikelihood is not correctly specified in this case,
    and statistics based on it, such AIC or likelihood ratio tests, are not
    appropriate.

    ----------
    df_model : float
        Model degrees of freedom is equal to p - 1, where p is the number
        of regressors.  Note that the intercept is not reported as a
        degree of freedom.
    df_resid : float
        Residual degrees of freedom is equal to the number of observation n
        minus the number of regressors p.
    endog : array
        See above.  Note that `endog` is a reference to the data so that if
        data is already an array and it is changed, then `endog` changes
        as well.
    exposure : array-like
        Include ln(exposure) in model with coefficient constrained to 1. Can
        only be used if the link is the logarithm function.
    exog : array
        See above.  Note that `exog` is a reference to the data so that if
        data is already an array and it is changed, then `exog` changes
        as well.
    freq_weights : array
        See above. Note that `freq_weights` is a reference to the data so that
        if data is already an array and it is changed, then `freq_weights`
        changes as well.
    var_weights : array
        See above. Note that `var_weights` is a reference to the data so that
        if data is already an array and it is changed, then `var_weights`
        changes as well.
    iteration : int
        The number of iterations that fit has run.  Initialized at 0.
    family : family class instance
        The distribution family of the model. Can be any family in
        sm2.families.  Default is Gaussian.
    mu : array
        The mean response of the transformed variable.  `mu` is the value of
        the inverse of the link function at lin_pred, where lin_pred is the
        linear predicted value of the WLS fit of the transformed variable.
        `mu` is only available after fit is called.  See
        sm2.families.family.fitted of the distribution family for more
        information.
    n_trials : array
        See above. Note that `n_trials` is a reference to the data so that if
        data is already an array and it is changed, then `n_trials` changes
        as well. `n_trials` is the number of binomial trials and only available
        with that distribution. See sm2.families.Binomial for more
        information.
    offset : array-like
        Include offset in model with coefficient constrained to 1.

        for more information.
    scaletype : str
        The scaling used for fitting the model.  This is only available after
        fit is called.  The default is None.  See GLM.fit for more information.

        If IRLS fitting used, the following additional parameters are
        available:

        atol : float, optional
            The absolute tolerance criterion that must be satisfied. Defaults
            to ``tol``. Convergence is attained when:
            :math:`rtol * prior + atol > abs(current - prior)`
        rtol : float, optional
            The relative tolerance criterion that must be satisfied. Defaults
            to 0 which means ``rtol`` is not used. Convergence is attained
            when:
            :math:`rtol * prior + atol > abs(current - prior)`
        tol_criterion : str, optional
            Defaults to ``'deviance'``. Can optionally be ``'params'``.
        wls_method : str, optional
            options are 'lstsq', 'pinv' and 'qr'
            specifies which linear algebra function to use for the irls
            optimization. Default is `lstsq` which uses the same underlying
            svd based approach as 'pinv', but is faster during iterations.
            'lstsq' and 'pinv' regularize the estimate in singular and
            near-singular cases by truncating small singular values based
            on `rcond` of the respective numpy.linalg function. 'qr' is
            only valied for cases that are not singular nor near-singular.

        If a scipy optimizer is used, the following additional parameter is
        available:

        optim_hessian : {'eim', 'oim'}, optional
            When 'oim', the default, the observed Hessian is used in fitting.
            'eim' is the expected Hessian. This may provide more stable fits,
            but adds assumption that the Hessian is correctly specified.

        Notes
        -----
        If method is 'IRLS', then an additional keyword 'attach_wls' is
        available. This is currently for internal use only and might change
        in future versions. If attach_wls' is true, then the final WLS
        instance of the IRLS iteration is attached to the results instance
        as `results_wls` attribute.

            Only the `elastic_net` approach is currently implemented.
        alpha : scalar or array-like
            The penalty weight.  If a scalar, the same penalty weight
            applies to all variables in the model.  If a vector, it
            must have the same length as `params`, and contains a

        An array, or a GLMResults object of the same type returned by `fit`.

        Notes
        -----
        The penalty is the ``elastic net`` penalty, which is a
        combination of L1 and L2 penalties.

        The function that is minimized is:

        .. math::

            -loglike/n + alpha*((1-L1\_wt)*|params|_2^2/2 + L1\_wt*|params|_1)

        where :math:`|*|_1` and :math:`|*|_2` are the L1 and L2 norms.

        Post-estimation results are based on the same data used to
        select variables, hence may be subject to overfitting biases.

        The elastic_net method uses the following keyword arguments:

        maxiter : int
            Maximum number of iterations
        L1_wt  : float
            Must be in [0, 1].  The L1 penalty has weight L1_wt and the
            L2 penalty has weight 1 - L1_wt.
        cnvrg_tol : float
