        PEBCAW (Problem Exists Between Computer And World) monitors internet
        connection security by comparing the observed IP with a whitelist of VPN
        and Tor IPs. It notifies if the IP is not in the whitelist, and
        optionally can notify if the IP is in a SIGINT country, and optionally
        can display IP details continuously.
