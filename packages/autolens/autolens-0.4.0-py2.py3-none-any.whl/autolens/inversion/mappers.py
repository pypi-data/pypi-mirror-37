        """
        Abstract base class representing the mapping between the pixels in an observed _image of a strong lens and \
        the pixels of a pixelization.

        1D arrays are used to represent these mappings, in particular between the different _image-grids (e.g. the \
        _image and sub grids, see the *imaging.mask module*). The nomenclature here follows grid_to_grid, whereby the \
        index of a value on one grid equals another. For howtolens:

        - image_to_pixelization[2] = 1 tells us that the 3rd _image-pixel maps to the 2nd pixelization-pixel.
        - sub_to_pixelization[4] = 2 tells us that the 5th sub-pixel maps to the 3rd pixelization-pixel.
        - pixelization_to_image[2] = 5 tells us that the 3rd pixelization-pixel maps to the 6th (masked) _image-pixel.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels : int
            The number of pixels in the pixelization.
        grids: mask.ImagingGrids
            A collection of grid describing the observed _image's pixel coordinates (includes an _image and sub grid).

        For howtolens, if the observed _image has 5 pixels and the pixelization 3 pixels, with the following mappings:

        _image pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
        _image pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 0
        _image pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 4 -> pixelization pixel 2

        The mapping matrix (which is of dimensions image_pixels x source_pixels) would appear as follows:

        [1, 0, 0] [1->0]

        [0, 1, 0] [3->1]
        [0, 0, 1] [4->2]

        The mapping matrix is in fact built using the sub-grid of the observed _image, where each _image-pixel is \
        divided into a regular grid of sub-pixels each of which are paired to pixels in the pixelization. The entires \
        in the mapping matrix now become fractional values dependent on the sub-grid size. For howtolens, for a 2x2 \
        sub-grid in each pixel (which means the fraction value is 1.0/(2.0^2) = 0.25, if we have the following mappings:

        _image pixel 0 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
        _image pixel 0 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 0 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 0 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 1 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 1 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 1 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 1 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        _image pixel 2 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 2

        _image pixel 2 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 3
        _image pixel 2 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 3

        The mapping matrix (which is still of dimensions image_pixels x source_pixels) would appear as follows:
