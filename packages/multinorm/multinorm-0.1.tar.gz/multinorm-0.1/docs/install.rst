Install
=======

To install ``multinorm`` use pip::

    pip install multinorm

This will also install `numpy`_ and `scipy`_ as a core dependencies.

If you want to call the plotting methods, you should install
`matplotlib`_ also.

This package consists of a single Python file `multinorm.py`_.
Most users will not care about this implementation detail,
but if you'd like to copy and "vendor" it for some reason,
you can bundle a copy and avoid the extra dependency for just one file and class.
