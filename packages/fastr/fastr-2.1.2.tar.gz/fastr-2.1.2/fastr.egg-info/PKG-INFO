Description: =====
        FASTR
        =====
        
        FASTR is a framework that helps creating workflows of different
        tools. The workflows created in FASTR are automatically enhanced
        with flexible data input/output, execution options (local, cluster,
        etc) and solid provenance.
        
        We chose to create tools by creating wrappers around executables
        and connecting everything with Python.
