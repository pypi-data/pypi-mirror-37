FASTR
=====

FASTR is a framework that helps creating workflows of different
tools. The workflows created in FASTR are automatically enhanced
with flexible data input/output, execution options (local, cluster,
etc) and solid provenance.

We chose to create tools by creating wrappers around executables
and connecting everything with Python.

Fastr is open-source (licensed under the Apache 2.0 license) and hosted on
bitbucket at https://bitbucket.org/bigr_erasmusmc/fastr
