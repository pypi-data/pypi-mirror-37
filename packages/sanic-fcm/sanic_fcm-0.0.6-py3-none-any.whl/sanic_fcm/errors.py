class FCMNotRegistered(FCMError):

    Not registered.
    200
    An existing registration token may cease to be valid in a number of scenarios, including:
    * If the client app unregisters with FCM.
    * If the client app is automatically unregistered, which can happen if the user uninstalls the
    application. For example, on iOS, if the APNS Feedback Service reported the APNS token as
    invalid.
    * If the registration token expires (for example, Google might decide to refresh registration
    tokens, or the APNS token has expired for iOS devices).
    * If the client app is updated but the new version is not configured to receive messages.
    For all these cases, remove this registration token from the app server and stop using it to
    send messages.

    Authentication error.
    401
    The sender account used to send a message couldn't be authenticated. Possible causes are:
    Authorization header missing or with invalid syntax in HTTP request.
    The Firebase project that the specified server key belongs to is incorrect.
    Legacy server keys onlyâ€”the request originated from a server not whitelisted in the Server key
    IPs.
    Check that the token you're sending inside the Authentication header is the correct Server key
    associated with your project. See Checking the validity of a Server key for details. If you are
    using a legacy server key, you're recommended to upgrade to a new key that has no IP
    restrictions.

class FCMMismatchSenderId(FCMError):
    """
    Mismatch sender_id.
    200
    A registration token is tied to a certain group of senders. When a client app registers for
    FCM, it must specify which senders are allowed to send messages. You should use one of those
    sender IDs when sending messages to the client app. If you switch to a different sender, the
    existing registration tokens won't work.

    both the keys and the values.

    Invalid data key.

    Check that the payload data does not contain a key (such as from, or gcm, or any value prefixed
    by google) that is used internally by FCM. Note that some words (such as collapse_key) are also
    used by FCM but are allowed in the payload, in which case the payload value will be overridden
    by the FCM value.

    The server couldn't process the request in time. Retry the same request, but you must:
    Honor the Retry-After header if it is included in the response from the FCM Connection Server.
    Implement exponential back-off in your retry mechanism. (e.g. if you waited one second before
    the first retry, wait at least two second before the next one, then 4 seconds and so on). If
    you're sending multiple messages, delay each one independently by an additional random amount
    to avoid issuing a new request for all messages at the same time.
    Senders that cause problems risk being blacklisted.
