    """Generate rasters from a base such that they align geospatially.

    This function resizes base rasters that are in the same geospatial
    projection such that the result is an aligned stack of rasters that have
    the same cell size, dimensions, and bounding box. This is achieved by
    clipping or resizing the rasters to intersected, unioned, or equivocated
    bounding boxes of all the raster and vector input.

    Parameters:
        base_raster_path_list (list): a list of base raster paths that will
            be transformed and will be used to determine the target bounding
            box.
        target_raster_path_list (list): a list of raster paths that will be
            created to one-to-one map with `base_raster_path_list` as aligned
            versions of those original rasters.
        resample_method_list (list): a list of resampling methods which
            one to one map each path in `base_raster_path_list` during
            resizing.  Each element must be one of
            "nearest|bilinear|cubic|cubic_spline|lanczos|mode".
        target_pixel_size (tuple): the target raster's x and y pixel size
            example: [30, -30].
        bounding_box_mode (string): one of "union", "intersection", or
            a list of floats of the form [minx, miny, maxx, maxy].  Depending
            on the value, output extents are defined as the union,
            intersection, or the explicit bounding box.
        base_vector_path_list (list): a list of base vector paths whose
            bounding boxes will be used to determine the final bounding box
            of the raster stack if mode is 'union' or 'intersection'.  If mode
            is 'bb=[...]' then these vectors are not used in any calculation.
        raster_align_index (int): indicates the index of a
            raster in `base_raster_path_list` that the target rasters'
            bounding boxes pixels should align with.  This feature allows
            rasters whose raster dimensions are the same, but bounding boxes
            slightly shifted less than a pixel size to align with a desired
            grid layout.  If `None` then the bounding box of the target
            rasters is calculated as the precise intersection, union, or
            bounding box.
        gtiff_creation_options (list): list of strings that will be passed
            as GDAL "dataset" creation options to the GTIFF driver, or ignored
            if None.

    Returns:
        None
