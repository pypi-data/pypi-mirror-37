# Quail Overview
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/QuailTeam/Quail.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/QuailTeam/Quail)

Easy to use cross-platform installer & updater

Our goal is to make deploying and updating desktop applications as simple as possible

Today you can deploy a simple solution in less than 10 lines

Quail is currently in development stage, everything is subject to change

## Current features
* Windows and Linux compatibility
* Install and uninstall an application (Add launch shortcut and register program on the system)
* Many ways to deploy and/or update your application:
  - Github release
  - FTP server
  - Embedded in installer (offline installer)
* Graphical user interface
* Scriptable user interface
* Configuration management
* Custom scriptable install/uninstall actions
* Configurable "Force update" or "Ask for update"


## Installation
1. Install python 3.6
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/
2. Install Tkinter (if its not already in python3) on debian/ubuntu:
```sudo apt-get install python3-tk``` on fedora ```sudo dnf install python3-tk```
3. Install Quail
```python3 -m pip install iquail```


## Using Quail
Currently everything is subject to change, this is the main reason why there is no documentation yet,

You can still begin learning by [examples](examples)

To build a quail installer run ```quail_script.py --quail_build```

## Short time goals
* Signing quail's executables
* Integrity verification and updating only modified data
* Building a versioning server
* Using quail to update solutions which already have an installer .msi / .deb / setup.exe / .rpm  files
* Mac OS support
