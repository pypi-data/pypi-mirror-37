Description: ===============
        Gabbi + Tempest
        ===============
        
        Gabbi-tempest is a Tempest_ plugin_ that enables testing the APIs of running
        OpenStack services, integrated with tempest but without needing to write
        Python. Instead the YAML format_ provided by gabbi_ is used to write and
        evaluate HTTP requests and responses.
        
        Tests are placed in YAML files in one or more directories. Those directories
        are added to a ``GABBI_TEMPEST_PATH`` environment variable. When that variable
        is passed into a tempest test runner that is aware of the gabbi plugin, the
        files on that path will be used to create tempests tests.
        
        The test harness sets a series of enviornment variables that can be used in
        the YAML to reach the available services. The available variables may be
        extended in two ways:
        
        * Adding them to the environment that calls tempest if the values are
          known.
        * Setting them in a subclass of the plugin if the values need to
          be calculated from what tempest knows.
        
        For each service in the service catalog there are
        ``<SERVICE_TYPE>_SERVICE`` and ``<SERVICE_TYPE>_BASE`` variables
        (e.g., ``PLACEMENT_SERVICE`` and ``PLACEMENT_BASE``). A useful
        ``SERVICE_TOKEN``, ``IMAGE_REF``, ``FLAVOR_REF`` and ``FLAVOR_REF_ALT``
        are also available.
