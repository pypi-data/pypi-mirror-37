Description: # django-cmsplugin-diff
        
        ## What does it do?
        
        Provides a history of changes, when plugins were edited, by who, when pages
        are published and by who. It tracks the languages of each and provides a diff
        showing what changed in both a field based view and a body based view.
        
        This plugin is in development and is considered BETA, please test and report issues.
        
        ## Demonstration
        
        To set up the demonstration on your local machine, you can::
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/doctormo/django-cmsplugin-diff
        
        cd django-cmsplugin-diff
        
        ./setup.py demo
        ```
        
        Then visit the generated website as instructed.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install cmsplugin-diff
        ```
        
        Add the plugin to your site's settings.py, making sure it goes BEFORE `cms` or the templates will not over-ride as expected::
        
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
          'django.contrib.humanize',
          ...
          'cmsplugin_diff',
          'cms',
          ...
        )
        ```
        
        Add the comment middleware, this allows us to record the user_id and the comment when editing plugins::
        
        ```
        MIDDLEWARE = [
          ...
          'cmsplugin_diff.middleware.EditCommentMiddleware',
          ...
        ]
        ```
        
        Add the urls to your urls.py::
        
        ```
        urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
          ...
          url(r'^diff/', include('cmsplugin_diff.urls', namespace='cmsplugin_diff')),
          ...
        )
        ```
