:warning: pdir2 will soon switch to a codebase that only supports Python 3.5+, because I want to add type hints and apply those cool toolings like mypy. The Python 2 compatible version will exist in the 0.3.x branch, and will still be receiving bug fixes. All new features will be developed on master therefore is Python 3.5+ exclusive.

In short, if you're still using pdir2 for Python <3.5, install via `pip install "pdir2>=0.3,<0.4"`.

# pdir2: Pretty dir() printing with joy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laike9m/pdir2.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/laike9m/pdir2)

Have you ever dreamed of a better output of `dir()`? I do. So I created this.

## Features
* Attributes are grouped by types/functionalities, with beautiful colors.

* Support color customization, [here's how](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/wiki/User-Configuration).

* Support all platforms including Windows(Thanks to [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama)).

* Support [ipython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython), [ptpython](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython), [bpython](https://www.bpython-interpreter.org/) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)! See [wiki](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/wiki/REPL-Support) for details.

* The return value of `pdir()` can still be used as a list of names.

* âœ¨ Attribute searching

  You can search for certain names with `.s()` or `.search()`:  

  ![](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/raw/master/images/search.gif)

  Search is case-insensitive by default.  
   `search(name, case_sensitive=True)` does case sensitive searching.

* :star2: Attribute filtering

  `properties`: Find properties/variables defined in the inspected object.

  `methods`: Find methods/functions defined in the inspected object.

  `public`: Find public attributes.

  `own`: Find attributes that are not inherited from parent classes.

  These filters **can be chained!** Order does **NOT** matter.

  For example, use `pdir(obj).public.own.methods` to find all public own methods.

  You can also call `search` on the returned results.

  See a [complete example](https://github.com/laike9m/pdir2/wiki/Attribute-Filtering).

## Install

### Generic
```
pip install pdir2
```
About the name. I wanted to call it "pdir", but there's already one with this
name on pypi. Mine is better, of course.

### Fedora
```
dnf install python3-pdir2
--or--
dnf install python2-pdir2
```

## Automatic Import
As a better alternative of `dir()`, it's more convenient to automatically import
pdir2 when launching REPL. Luckily, Python provides a way to do this. In you `.bashrc`(or `.zshrc`), add this line:
```
export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/.pythonstartup
```
Then, create `.pythonstartup` in your home folder. Add one line:
```
import pdir
```
Next time you launch REPL, `pdir()` is already there, Hooray!

## Testing
Simply run `pytest`, or use `tox` if you like.
