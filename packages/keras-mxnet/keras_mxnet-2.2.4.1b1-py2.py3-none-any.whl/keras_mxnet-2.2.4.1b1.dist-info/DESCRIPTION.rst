Keras is a high-level neural networks API,
written in Python. Keras-MXNet is capable of running on top of
high performance, scalable Apache MXNet deep learning engine.

Use Keras-MXNet if you need a deep learning library that:

- Allows for easy and fast prototyping
  (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
- Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks,
  as well as combinations of the two.
- Runs seamlessly on CPU, one GPU and multi-GPU.
