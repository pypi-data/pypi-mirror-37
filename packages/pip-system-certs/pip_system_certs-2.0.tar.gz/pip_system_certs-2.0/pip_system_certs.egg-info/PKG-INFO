Description: ================
        pip-system-certs
        ================
        
        This package patches pip and requests at runtime to use certificates from the default system store (rather than the bundled certs ca).
        
        This will allow pip to verify tls/ssl connections to servers who's cert is trusted by your system install.
        
        Simply install with::
        
          pip install pip_system_certs
        
        and pip should trust your https sites if your host os does.
        
        This also extends to all direct uses of the requests library (and other packages that use requests)
