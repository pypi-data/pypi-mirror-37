This module provides a single function ``solve_lp(c, G, h, A, b, solver=X)``
with a *solver* keyword argument to select the backend solver. The linear
program it solves is, in standard form:

.. code-block::

    min. c^T x
    s.t. G x <= h
         A x == b

where vector inequalities are taken coordinate by coordinate.

Solvers
-------

The list of supported solvers currently includes:

- `CVXOPT <http://cvxopt.org/>`_
- `cdd <https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pycddlib>`_

Example
-------

To solve a linear program, simply build the matrices that define it and call
the ``solve_lp`` function:

.. code:: python

    from numpy import array
    from lpsolvers import solve_lp

    c = array([1., 2., 3.])
    G = array([[1., 2., -1.], [2., 0., 1.], [1., 2., 1.], [-1., -1., -1.]])
    h = array([4., 1., 3., 2.])

    print "LP solution:", solve_lp(c, G, h)

This example outputs the solution ``[2.2 -0.8 -3.4]``.
