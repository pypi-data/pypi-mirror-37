[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorop.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/tensorop) 

A Library which contains handy modules for convenience in Machine Learning and improved Kaggle support. Based on Pytorch. It's currently under development. Same API as Pytorch and Numpy. Main aim is to bring all functionalities that DL frameworks may lack for some reason but are essentially required for research/implementation purposes.

## Installation
Installation via Pypi
```
$ pip install tensorop
```
Using with git
```
$ git clone https://github.com/prajjwal1/tensorop
$ cd tensorop
```
