        Load data bases from [Web of Science](https://www.webofknowledge.com), [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com), [Scielo](https://www.webofknowledge.com), etc, and combine the results into a single data base
        
        For WOSplus execution it is necessary to define drive.cfg file in which you can specify the name of the files and its shared key in Google drive. The drive.cfg file must be present in the execution folder. For example
        ``` bash
        $ cat drive.cfg
        [FILES]
        CIB_Scielo.xlsx                             = 0BxoOXsn2EUNIMldPUFlwNkdLOTQ
        ```
        See also the drive.cfg file in the test folder which gives some addresses of sample databases stored in google drive (password protected). If the file is not found in the google drive cloud, it is searched and loaded locally, by using just the name of the file.
        ## Installation
