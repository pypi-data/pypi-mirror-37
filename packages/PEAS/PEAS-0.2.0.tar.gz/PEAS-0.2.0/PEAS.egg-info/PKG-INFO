Description: # PEAS
        ## Proximal Enrichment by Approximated Sampling
        
        PEAS provides a pipeline to compute optimal sets of enriched or depleted signal in either a 1-D vector or 2-D matrix. 
        
        It also includes a module and command-line script that apply this method to the problem of finding such enriched or depleted areas of differences or correlations between columns of a genomic peak matrix.
