Module:
    genie

Description:
    This module defines the base classes required to write testscripts. It's
    name is a direct carry over from Tcl-ATS's AEtest package. 

    In short, this module is designed to offer a similar look-and-feel of its
    Tcl counterpart, whilst leveraging and building based on the advanced
    object-oriented capabilities of the Python Language.

    aetest can be broken down as follows:

        - Common Sections
        - Testcases
        - Python ``unittest`` support

    For more detailed explanation and usages, refer to aetest documentation on
    pyATS home page: http://wwwin-pyats.cisco.com/
