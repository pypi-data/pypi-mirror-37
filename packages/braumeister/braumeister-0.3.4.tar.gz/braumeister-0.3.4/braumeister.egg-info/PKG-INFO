        `braumeister` is a release-candidate preparation tool for git and JIRA users. 
        Given a fix-version, it gathers git branches mentioned in JIRA issues targetting this fix-version and merges them in a release-candidate branch.
        
        # Installation
        **The `braumeister` requires at least Python `3.5`**
        
        Install with:
        ```sh
        pip3 install braumeister
        ```
        
        # Configuration
        You can initialize the `braumeister` inside the root directory of a git repository like this:
        ```sh
        braumeister init
        ```
        
        The `braumeister` will create a `.braumeister` configuration file in the current directory. The configuration may look like this:
        
        ```ini
        [general]
        verbose = false
        
        [jira]
        url = https://jira.dev
        username = my-user
        password = secret
        destination_transition = Merged
        branch_custom_field_id = customfield_5711
        ```
        
        |Section|key|default value|description|
        |-------|---|-----|---|
        |general|verbose|false|Verbose output|
        |jira|url|None|JIRA Base URL|
        |jira|username|None|A JIRA User|
        |jira|password|None|The password for the user|
        |jira|destination_transition|None|Workflow Transition name for the ticket after merging, if executed with `-u`|
        |jira|branch_custom_field_id|None|The JIRA Custom Field where we should read the branch from|
        
        We'll be looking for a configuration file at the following places
        ```
        [CURRENT-DIRECTORY]/.braumeister
        ~/.braumeister
        ```
        
        **It's recommended to add the following files to your `.gitignore`**
        ```gitignore
        .braumeister
        release_state.json
        ```
        
        ## JIRA Configuration
        ### Custom Field für Branch anlegen
        In JIRA, press `gg` (or `.`) to open the "Quick Actions" > Type `Custom Fields` > `Add custom field` > `Text field (single line)` > `Next`
        ```
        Name: Branch
        Description: git Branch
        ```
        In the next screen, you need to assign the created field to one or more screens.
        The `branch_custom_field_id` is `customfield_[ID]` whereas the `ID` is the number in the URL behind the `customFieldId=`.
        e.g.:
        ```none
        https://jira.dev/secure/admin/ConfigureCustomField!default.jspa?customFieldId=57111
        ```
        Here, the JIRA Custom Field Id is `5711`, so the `braumeister` configuration for `branch_custom_field_id` would be `customfield_5711`.
        
        # Description
        The `braumeister` requests all issues from JIRA with the given release name as `Fix Version`.
        In theses tickets, we'll search for the configured custom field (eg Branch) containing the git branch.
        The release branch will be created like this:
        ```
        release/[cleaned_release_name]_RC_[LATEST_RC + 1]
        ```
        If the `braumeister` discovered a branch with the same name, we'll increase the `RC` part with 1 (with leading zeros). The first release branch will have the RC `001`.
        
        For each of theses branches, the following commands will be executed:
        ```sh
        $ git checkout $branch
        $ git pull
        $ git merge origin/master
        $ git push origin $branch
        $ git checkout $release_branch
        $ git merge origin/$branch
        $ git branch -D $branch
        ```
        
        After merging all branches to the release branch, the branch will be pushed to `origin`.
        
        ## Conflicts
        If there are any conflicts during the merge of a branch, the `braumeister` will stop and write the current state to a `release_state.json` file. The output may looks like this:
        ```sh
        $ braumeister -n "Barking Dog" candidate
        [*] Requesting all issues with fixVersion: Barking Dog
        [+] Requesting issue: https://jira.dev/rest/api/2/issue/5711
        [+] Requesting issue: https://jira.dev/rest/api/2/issue/5712
        [+] Requesting issue: https://jira.dev/rest/api/2/issue/5713
        [+] The last branch for RC Barking Dog is:   release/Barking_Dog_RC_002

        Writing state json!
        
        A merge error occured while merging feature into release/Barking_Dog_RC_003
        
        Please do the following steps:
        	* Resolve the conflicts
        	* Commit the changes
        	* Call the script again with the option -r
        ```
        
        The `braumeister` will stay in the current release branch to let you resolve the conflict. After the conflict has been resolved, you can rerun the `braumeister` with `-r` to resume where we stopped.
        
        ```sh
        $ braumeister -n "Barking Dog" -r candidate

        ## Examples
        
        ### Release Candidate
        
        #### New release candidate
        ```sh

        ```
        
        #### Existing release candidate
        When you execute the `braumeister` with the same release name again, a new release candidate will be created (increasing the `RC` part with 1).
        
        ```sh
        $ braumeister -n "Barking Dog" candidate
        [*] Requesting all issues with fixVersion: Barking Dog
        [+] Requesting issue: https://jira.dev/rest/api/2/issue/5711

        #### Update JIRA issue
        Executing the `braumeister` with `-u` will also execute the configured transition on all related issues.
        
        ```sh
        $ braumeister -n "Barking Dog" -u candidate
        [*] Requesting all issues with fixVersion: Barking Dog

        #### Finalize a release
        When you execute the `braumeister` with the `finalize` action it will merge the given branch back to `origin/master`. 
        
        THIS CHANGES YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY, HANDLE WITH CARE!
        
        ```sh
        $ braumeister -n "Barking Dog" finalize

        ```
        
        #### Cleanup after a release
        When you execute the `braumeister` with the `cleanup` action it will delete all branches associated with tickets in your `fixVersion`.
        
        THIS CHANGES YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY, HANDLE WITH CARE!
        
        ```sh
        $ braumeister -n "Barking Dog" cleanup
