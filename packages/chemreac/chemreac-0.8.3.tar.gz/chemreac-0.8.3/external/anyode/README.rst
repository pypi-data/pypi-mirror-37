anyode provides C++ headers used by:

- `pyodesys <https://github.com/bjodah/pyodesys>`_
- `pycvodes <https://github.com/bjodah/pycvodes>`_
- `pyodeint <https://github.com/bjodah/pyodeint>`_
- `pygslodeiv2 <https://github.com/bjodah/pygslodeiv2>`_

Notes
-----
When compiled with ``-DNDEBUG`` then ``AnyODE::buffer_factory`` will return a ``std::unique_ptr`` to an (unitizialized)
array. When compiled without ``NDEBUG`` it will instead return a ``std::vector`` initizlied with signaling NaN.

By default, AnyODE uses BLAS/LAPACK for preconditioning operations on the Jacobian matrix. If you do not have
(or do not wish to compile with) BLAS/LAPACK, ``-DANYODE_NO_LAPACK=1`` should be set, in which case built-in
linear algebra routines will be substituted.
