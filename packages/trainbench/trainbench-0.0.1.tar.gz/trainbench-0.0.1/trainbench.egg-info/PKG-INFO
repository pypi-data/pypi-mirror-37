        # Trainbench 
        
        Trainbench is a tool for quickly setup a (Deep Learning) cross-validation training session with configuration instantiation, learned weights, plots, etc, recording at each training epoch.
        
        Compatible with Keras.
        
        **! ⚠️ This  package is currently under active development ⚠️ !**
        
        ## Getting started
        
        ##### Install
        ```bash
        pip install trainbench
        ```
        
        ##### Create a train session
        ```python
        # train.py
        
        # name
        name = 'experiment_01'
        
        # parameters to cross validate against
        parameters = {
            'fc_size': [256, 512, 1024]    
            # ...
        }
        
        def train(parameters):
            xyz = parameters['xyz']
            # ...
            
            
        ```
        
        ##### Running from the command line
        ```bash
        trainbench .
        ```

        parameters = {
        
        }
        
        def train_fn(parameters):
            pass
            
        bench = Bench()
        bench.train('experiment_xyz', train_fn, parameters)
        ```
