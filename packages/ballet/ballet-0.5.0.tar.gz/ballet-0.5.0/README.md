# ballet

A **light**weight framework for collaborative data science projects with a focus on **feat**ure engineering.

- *ballet* defines robust `Feature` and `FeaturePipeline` objects built
alongside the `sklearn_pandas` project, as well as providing a host of other functionality.
- *ballet.eng* is a library of versatile transformers for feature engineering built
on top of the base `Feature` abstraction.

Note: *ballet* is under active development, please [report all
bugs](https://hdi-project.github.io/ballet/contributing.html#report-bugs).
