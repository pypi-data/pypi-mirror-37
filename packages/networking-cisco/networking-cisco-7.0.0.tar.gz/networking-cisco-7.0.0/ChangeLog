Change the authentication syntax to be more aligned with auth\_section    in preparation of using auth plugin in the future. i.e., instead of using    admin\_user\_name, use username... 2. Added more flexibility that if those authentication credential fields    are not present in openstack configure file, we can add them in our    enabler\_conf.ini.  To do that, we here eliminated the dependency on nova    config file. 3. If a field is present in both openstack and our enabler\_conf.ini, our    config file will overwrite 4. In the future, we will totally eliminate the reading of openstack config    file. But for now, we don't want much code changes, so still keep the current    way of reading neutron and keystone config files
