    Nexus: DBDuplicateEntry error from interface mapping db table with multi-controllers

    When there are multiple controllers running, they could simultaneously attempt to
    initialize the Nexus host interface mapping db table using the user's static host
    mapping configuration. This could result in a `DBDuplicateEntry` exception.  This
    type of error is seen with static user configured hosts but not ironic learned
    hosts.  Refer to :ref:`dupl_entry` for error message details and corrective action.
