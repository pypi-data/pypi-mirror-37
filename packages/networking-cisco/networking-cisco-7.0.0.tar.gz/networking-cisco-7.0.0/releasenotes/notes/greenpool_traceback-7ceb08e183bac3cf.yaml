      ASR1k: Fix greenpool.py traceback in Ocata

      The ASR1k plugin was wrapping neutron and plugin DB operations
      in common transactions that was generating a lot of strange
      tracebacks in the neutron server logs. This commit removes
      the transaction wrapper to make the operations more independent
      of each other, eliminating the tracebacks entirely.
