The networking-cisco project's goal is to provide support for Cisco networking
hardware and software in OpenStack deployments. This includes ML2 drivers and
agents for neutron, as well as other pieces of software which interact with
neutron to best utilise your Cisco products with OpenStack.

Releases and Version Support
============================

We have a goal to maintain compatibility with each version of OpenStack for as
long as possible, so starting with version 4.0.0, networking-cisco was
compatible with both the Mitaka and Newton OpenStack releases. As such
networking-cisco is branchless and stable releases that are compatible with
multiple OpenStack versions will be cut from our master branch.

The latest (6.x) release of networking-cisco is compatible with the Mitaka,
Newton, Ocata, Pike and Queens releases of OpenStack.
