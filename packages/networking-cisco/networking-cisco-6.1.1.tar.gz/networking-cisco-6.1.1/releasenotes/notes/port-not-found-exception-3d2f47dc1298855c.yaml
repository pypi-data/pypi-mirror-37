    Nexus: Do not raise exception during update_postcommit when port not found

    Occasionally spurious updates are seen in parallel with deletes for same
    vlan.  In this window an update can be received after the port binding
    is removed.  This change reports a warning message instead of raising
    an exception keeping it consistent with other ML2 driver behavior.  This
    circumstance will more likely be seen when there are multiple neutron
    threads and controllers.
