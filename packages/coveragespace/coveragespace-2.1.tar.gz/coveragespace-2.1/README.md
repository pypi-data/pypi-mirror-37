# Overview

The official command-line client for [The Coverage Space](http://coverage.space).

# Setup

## Requirements

* Python 2.7+ or Python 3.3+

## Installation

The client can be installed with pip:

```sh
$ pip install --upgrade coveragespace
```

or directly from the source code:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jacebrowning/coverage-space-cli.git
$ cd coverage-space-cli
$ python setup.py install
```

# Usage

To update the value for a test coverage metric:

```sh
$ coveragespace <owner/repo> <metric>
```

For example, after testing with code coverage enabled:

```sh
$ coveragespace owner/repo unit
```

will attempt to extract the current coverage data from your working tree and compare that with the last known value. The coverage value can also be manually specified:

```sh
$ coveragespace <owner/repo> <metric> <value>
```
