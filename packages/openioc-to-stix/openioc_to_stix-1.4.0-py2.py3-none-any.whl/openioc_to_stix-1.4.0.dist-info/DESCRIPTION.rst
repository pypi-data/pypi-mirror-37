Overview
--------

The **openioc-to-stix** script generates STIX Indicators from an OpenIOC v1.0
XML file.

* Compatible with OpenIOC v1.0
* Generates STIX v1.2 and CybOX v2.1 content.

Please refer to the following websites for more information about the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX),
Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX), and OpenIOC efforts.

* STIX - https://stixproject.github.io/
* CybOX - https://cyboxproject.github.io/
* OpenIOC - http://www.openioc.org

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6
* mixbox >= v1.0.1
* python-stix >= v1.2.0.2
* python-cybox >= 2.1.0.13

**NOTE** Version 1.0.1 of openioc-to-stix requires python-stix < 1.2.0.0,
python-cybox 2.1.0.12, and does not require mixbox.

Installation
------------

Extract included files into your directory of choice. Please refer to the
``requirements.txt`` file for dependencies.

Install dependencies with pip::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You can also install **openioc-to-stix** into your ``site-packages`` and ``PATH``
by using `pip`::

    $ cd /path/to/cloned/openioc-to-stix/repo/
    $ pip install .

Usage
-----

There are two main command line parameters for this script::

    -i: the path to the input OpenIOC XML file
    -o: the path to the output STIX XML file

To use the script, run the following command::

    $ python openioc-to-stix.py -i <OpenIOC XML file> -o <STIX XML file>

Unsupported indicator items or those that error out during translation will be
translated into an empty Observable with a description of the error in order
to retain structural consistency between the input OpenIOC document and
output STIX document.
