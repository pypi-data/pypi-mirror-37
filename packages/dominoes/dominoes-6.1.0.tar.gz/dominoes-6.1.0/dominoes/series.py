import dominoes

class Series:
    '''
    Python class for objects that represent a series of dominoes games.

    A series of dominoes games is played with 4 players, split into two teams.
    They will then play a sequence of games and keep a running tally of how
    many points each team has scored. When a team's cumulative score surpasses
    some predetermined threshold (usually 100 or 200), that team wins.

    Prior to starting the series, the teams agree to a starting domino (usually
    [6|6]). The player that draws this domino during the first game will play
    first. The starting player for subsequent games is determined as follows:

    * If a player wins by playing their last domino, that player will start the
      following game.
    * If a player makes the game stuck, and his/her team wins, that player will
      start the following game.
    * If a player makes the game stuck, and there is a tie, the player who
      started that game will start the following game.
    * If a player makes the game stuck, and his/her team loses, then the
      following player (from the other team) will start the following game.

    :param int target_score: score up to which the series will be played;
                             defaults to 200
    :param Domino starting_domino: domino that will determine which player
                                   starts the first game; defaults to [6|6]
    :var games: ordered list of games played in the series
    :var scores: list containing the two teams' scores; team 0 has players 0
                 and 2, and team 1 has players 1 and 3
    :var target_score: score up to which the series will be played
