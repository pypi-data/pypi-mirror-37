sanic_brogz
===========

sanic_brogz is an extension which allows you to easily brotli compress
or gzip your Sanic responses. It is a fork of the
`sanic_compress <https://github.com/subyraman/sanic_compress>`__ package
which is a port of the
`Flask-Compress <https://github.com/libwilliam/flask-compress>`__
extension.

Installation
------------

Install with ``pip``:

``pip install sanic_brogz``

Usage
-----

Usage is simple. Simply pass in the Sanic app object to the ``Compress``
class, and responses will be brotli compressed or gzipped.

.. code:: python

   from sanic import Sanic
   from sanic_brogz import Compress

   app = Sanic(__name__)
   Compress(app)

Options
-------

Within the Sanic application config you can provide the following
settings to control the behavior of sanic_brogz. None of the settings
are required.

``COMPRESS_MIMETYPES``: Set the list of mimetypes to compress here. -
Default:
``{'text/html','text/css','text/xml','application/json','application/javascript'}``

``COMPRESS_LEVEL``: Specifies the gzip compression level (1-9) or brotli
compression level (1-11). - Default: ``6``

``COMPRESS_MIN_SIZE``: Specifies the minimum size (in bytes) threshold
for compressing responses. - Default: ``500``

A higher ``COMPRESS_LEVEL`` will result in a gzipped response that is
smaller, but the compression will take longer.

Example of using custom configuration:

.. code:: python

   from sanic import Sanic
   from sanic_brogz import Compress

   app = Sanic(__name__)
   app.config['COMPRESS_MIMETYPES'] = {'text/html', 'application/json'}
   app.config['COMPRESS_LEVEL'] = 4
   app.config['COMPRESS_MIN_SIZE'] = 300
   Compress(app)

Note about compressing static files:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sanic is not at heart a file server. You should consider serving static
files with nginx or on a separate file server.
