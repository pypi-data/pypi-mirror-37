Description: # A couchdb storage backend for Django
        
        For each upload, a new document with the file attached is created.
        
        ## Setup
        
        Install this package with pip:
        
        `pip install -U django-couchdb-storage` 
        
        Add it to your INSTALLED_APPS in django settings:
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
        
            'couch',
        ]
        ```
        
        And and configuration to point django to your couchdb:
        
        ```python
        DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'couchdb_storage.CouchDBStorage'
        COUCHDB_HOST = 'http://127.0.0.1:5984'
        COUCHDB_DATABASE = 'django_storage'
        COUCHDB_USER = ''
        COUCHDB_PASSWORD = ''
        ```
        
        ## Constraints
        
        Right now, this package assumes that content from the storage database can be read anonymously. Writes are authenticated. It is also assumed, that the db host can be accessed publicly.
