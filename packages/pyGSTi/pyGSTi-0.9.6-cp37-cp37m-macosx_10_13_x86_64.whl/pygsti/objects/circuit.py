    A Circuit is a more structured representation of a sequence of preparation,
    gate, and measurement operations.  It is composed of some number of "lines",
    typically one per qubit, and permits a richer set of operations than 
    :class:`GateString`.  These operations include a range of methods for
    manipulating quantum circuits. E.g., basic depth compression algorithms.

        """
        Creates a new Circuit object, encapsulating a quantum circuit.

        You can supply at most one of `line_items` and `gatestring` (alternate
        ways of specifying the gates).  If neither are specified an empty
        Circuit is created.  Unless `line_items` is specified, you must also
        specify the number of lines via `num_lines` and/or `line_labels`. If
        labels aren't specified they default to the integers starting at 0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        line_items : list, optional
            A list of lists of Label objects, giving the gate labels present on
            each "line" (usually "qubit") of the circuit.  When a gate occupies
            more than one line its label is present in the lists of *all* the
            lines it occupies.

        gatestring : list, optional
            A list of Label objects, specifying a serial sequence of gates to
            be made into a circuit.  Gates are placed in as few "layers" as 
            possible, meaning that gates acting on different qubits are 
            done in parallel (placed at the same position in their respective
            lines).  This is equivalent to saying the list for each line is 
            made as short as possible.

        num_lines : int, optional
            The number of lines (usually qubits).  You only need to specify 
            this when it cannot be inferred, that is, when `line_items` or
            `line_labels` is not given.

        line_labels : list, optional
            A list of strings or integers labelling each of the lines.  The
            length of this list equals the number of lines in the circuit, 
            and if `line_labels` is not given these labels default to the 
            integers starting with 0.

        parallelize : bool, optional
            Only used when initializing from `gatestring`.  When True, automatic
            parallelization is performed: consecutive gates in `gatestring`
            acting on disjoint sets of qubits are placed in the same layer.

        identity : str, optional
            The "name" for the identity gate. This is the gate name that will
            be used to "pad" layers: qubits that are without a gate in
            a layer when the circuit is constructed will be assigned an idle gate
            with a name fixed by this string. Unlike all other gates, the created
            circuit "knows" that this particular gate is an idle. So, the circuit
            will potentially drop idle gates when doing depth-compression, whereas 
            all other gates are treat as having an unspecified action, by all methods
            of the circuit, unless the relationship between the gates is given to 
            a method of circuit.

        """
        Re-express a circuit over a different gateset.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        compilation : dict or CompilationLibrary.
            If a dictionary, the keys are some or all of the gates that appear in the circuit, and the values are 
            replacement circuits that are normally compilations for each of these gates (if they are not, the action 
            of the circuit will be changed). The circuits need not be on all of the qubits, and need only satisfy
            the requirements of the `insert_circuit` method. There must be a key for every gate except the self.identity
            gate, unless `allow_unchanged_gates` is False. In that case, gate that aren't a key in this dictionary are
            left unchanged.

            If a CompilationLibrary, this will be queried via the get_compilation_of() method to find compilations
            for all of the gates in the circuit. So this CompilationLibrary must contain or be able to auto-generate
            compilations for the requested gates, except when `allow_unchanged_gates` is True. In that case, gates
            that a compilation is not returned for are left unchanged.

        allowed_filter : dict or set, optional
            Specifies which gates are allowed to be used when generating compilations from `compilation`. Can only be
            not None if `compilation` is a CompilationLibrary. If a `dict`, keys must be gate names (like `"Gcnot"`) and
            values :class:`QubitGraph` objects indicating where that gate (if it's present in the library) may be used.
            If a `set`, then it specifies a set of qubits and any gate in the current library that is confined within that 
            set is allowed. If None, then all gates within the library are allowed.

        depth_compression : bool, optional
            Whether to perform depth compression after changing the gate library. If oneQgate_relations is None this
            will only remove idle layers and compress the circuit by moving everything as far forward as is possible
            without knowledge of the action of any gates other than self.identity. See the `depth_compression` method
            for more details. Under most circumstances this should be true; if it is False changing gate library will
            often result in a massive increase in circuit depth.
  
        oneQgate_relations : dict, optional
            Gate relations for the one-qubit gates in the new gate library, that are used in the  depth compression, to 
            cancel / combine gates. E.g., one key-value pair might be  ('Gh','Gh') : 'I', to signify that two Hadamards c
            ompose to the idle gate 'Gi'. See the depth_compression() method for more details.

        identity : str, optional
            A new name for the identity/idle gate. If not None, we set self.identity = identity and rename any gates
            that have the old identity name with the new identity name -- unless there is a compilation provided for
            gates with the old identity name; compilations for the old identity take precedence over this renaming

            is a sequence of 1-qubit gates with names name1, name2, name3, ... and there are relations
            for all of (name1,name2) -> name12, (name12,name3) -> name123 etc then the entire sequence of
            1-qubit gates will be compressed into a single possibly non-idle 1-qubit gate followed by 
            idle gates in place of the previous 1-qubit gates.

            If a ProcessorSpec object has been created for the gates/device in question, the
            ProcessorSpec.oneQgate_relations is the appropriate (and auto-generated) `oneQgate_relations`.

            Note that this function will not compress sequences of 1-qubit gates that cannot be compressed by 
            independently inspecting sequential non-idle pairs (as would be the case with, for example, 
            Gxpi Gzpi Gxpi Gzpi, if the relation did not know that (Gxpi,Gzpi) -> Gypi, even though the sequence
            is the identity).
