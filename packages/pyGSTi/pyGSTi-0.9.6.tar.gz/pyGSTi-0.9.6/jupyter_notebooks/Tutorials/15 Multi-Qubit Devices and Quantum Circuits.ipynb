Normally this will be the \"primitive\" gates of the device, although it may sometimes be useful to choose other gate-sets (it depends what you are then going to use the `ProcessorSpec` for). Currently only discrete gate-sets are supported. E.g., there is no way to specify an arbitrary $\\sigma_z$-rotation as one of the gates in the device. Parameterized gates will likely be supported in the future.\n",

This conversion is automatic for circuits that containing only gates with name that are in-built into `pyGSTi` (see earlier and the docstring of `pygsti.tools.internalgates.get_standard_gatename_unitaries()`). This is with some exceptions in the case of Quil: currently not all of the in-built gate names can be converted to quil gate names automatically, but this will be fixed in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "For other gate names (or even more crucially, if you have re-purposed any of the gate names that `pyGSTi` knows for a different unitary), the desired gate name conversation must be specified as an optional argument for both `convert_to_openqasm()` and `convert_to_quil()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Circuits with qubit labels of the form 'Qi' or with integer labels are auto-converted to the corresponding integer. If this labelling convention is used but the mapping should be different, or if the qubit labelling in the circuit is not of one of these two forms, this mapping should also be handed to these conversion methods."
