Description: Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
        ==========================================
        
        This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
        produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draft
        submissions.
        
        id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
        on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
        source is available.
        
        Version 1.x can process the drafts specified in the development Statement of
        Work to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number of
        other test files to acceptable XML.  Missing is internal <xref/> links to
        figures and tables.
        
        The default XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 1.x of the tool.
        With version 1.3.0 of the tool, output according to RFC 7991 [2]_ is available
        by use of the '-3' switch.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        Version 1.4.4 (17 Oct 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Since '--' isn't allowed inside html comments, trying to add a comment 
            that contains that string will fail.  Under some circumstances, id2xml
            inserts comments about conversion errors into the generated xml, and
            if the failed text contained '--', this would fail.  Tweaked comment
            insertion to avoid this.
        
          * Added code to look for Abstract both before and after Status-of-Memo 
            and Copyright sections.  The placement of the Abstract changes around the 
            time of RFC 5550.
        
        
        
        
        Version 1.4.3 (12 Oct 2018)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed some issues with author recognition and an infinite loop.
        
          * Added handling for the grammar change 'a candidate' --> 'candidates' in 
            the status of memo boilerplate.
        
          * Aligned the short options for verbose and version with common practice.
