# ZeepLibrary
Robot Framework library for using [Zeep](https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master).

I've written this library to solve specific problems I encountered and I currently don't intend to take responsibility for turning this library into a more mature one. I might in the future however, but just bear this in mind.

Also, because of this, the library is in a quite infantile stage. On a positive note though, I did try my best to write it well and elegantly, so there's certainly a possibility you'll find this library useful, if not immediately then perhaps as a basis for adjusting it to your needs.

Of course you're more than welcome to contribute to this library, that would be appreciated!

## TODO
* As soon as the library is ready for it, I will start releasing stable, usable versions and distribute it on PyPI as well.
* Some basic functionality should still be implemented before a release can be taken seriously, such as calling SOAP methods.
* More documentation and stuff like installation instructions also has/have to be written.
