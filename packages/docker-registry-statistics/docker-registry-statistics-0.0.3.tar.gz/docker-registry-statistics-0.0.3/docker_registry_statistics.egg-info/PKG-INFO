Description: # Docker Registry Statistics
        
        This project aims to create tool which will calculate disk usage statistics 
        of docker registry.
        
        ## Instalation
        Project requires at least Python3.6, next just install package into virtualenv (or system if you don't mind)
        
        ```
        pip install gitlab-registry git+https://github.com/pbabics/docker-registry-statistics.git@master
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        Usage is fairly simple:
        ```
        docker_registry_statistics  <Path to registry> <Command>
        ```
        
        Right now these are implemented commands:
          * `statistics`
          * `orphaned_images`
          * `unused_blobs`
        
        Note that registry path should contain directory structure like `docker/registry/v2/...`
        for example this directory for Gitlab by default is `/var/opt/gitlab/gitlab-rails/shared/registry`.
        
        
        ### `statistics` command
        Goes through all tags, images and blobs and sumarized disk usage statistics, per repository and overall disk usage of registry.
        
        ### `orphaned_images` command
        Lists all images that are no longer used as a current image for tag under which they were pushed.
        
        ### `unused_blobs` command
        Lists all blobs that are not used by any image and are just using up disk space.
