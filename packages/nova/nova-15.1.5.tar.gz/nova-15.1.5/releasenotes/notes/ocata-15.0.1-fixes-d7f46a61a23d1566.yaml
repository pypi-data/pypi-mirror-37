    The 15.0.1 Ocata release contains fixes for several high severity, high
    impact bugs. If you have not yet upgraded to 15.0.0, it is recommended to
    upgrade directly to 15.0.1.
issues:

    There is a known regression in Ocata reported in `bug 1671648`_ where
    server build failures on a compute node are not retried on another compute
    node. The fix for this bug is being worked and will be provided shortly in
    a 15.0.2 release.

    `Bug 1670627`_ is fixed. This bug led to potential over-quota errors after
    several failed server build attempts, resulting in quota usage to reach the
    limit even though the servers were deleted.

    Unfortunately the ``nova-manage project quota_usage_refresh`` command will
    not reset the usages to fix this problem once encountered.

    If the project should not have any outstanding resource usage, then one
    possible workaround is to delete the existing quota usage for the project::

      ``nova quota-delete --tenant <tenant_id>``

    That will cleanup the ``project_user_quotas``, ``quota_usages`` and
    ``reservations`` tables for the given project in the ``nova`` database and
    reset the quota limits for the project back to the defaults defined in
    nova.conf.

    `Bug 1665263`_ is fixed. This was a regression where
    ``instance.delete.start`` and ``instance.delete.end`` notifications were
    not emitted when deleting an instance in ``ERROR`` state due to a failed
    build.
