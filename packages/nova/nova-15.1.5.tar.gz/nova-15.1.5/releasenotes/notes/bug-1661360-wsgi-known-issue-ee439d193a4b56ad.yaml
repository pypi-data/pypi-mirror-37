    Nova does not support running the nova-api service under mod_wsgi or uwsgi
    in Ocata. There are some experimental scripts that have been available
    for years which allow you do to this, but doing so in Ocata results in
    possible failures to list and show instance details in a cells v2 setup.
    See `bug 1661360`_ for details.
