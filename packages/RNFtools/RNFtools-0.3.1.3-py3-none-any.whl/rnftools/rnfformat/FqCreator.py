    """Class for writing RNF reads to FASTQ files.

	Every new read is added to the internal buffer. If read tuple ID is different,
	buffer is flushed. Hence, reads from the same tuple must be added in a series.
	It does not matter in which order are blocks reported and with which exact reads,
	they will be sorted during flushing.

	Args:
		fastq_fo (str): Output FASTQ file - file object.
		read_tuple_id_width (int): Maximal expected string length of read tuple ID.
		genome_id_width (int): Maximal expected string length of genome ID.
		chr_id_width (int): Maximal expected string length of chromosome ID.
		coor_width (int): Maximal expected string length of a coordinate.
		info_reads_in_tuple (bool): Include information about reads as a RNF comment.
		info_simulator (str): Name of used simulator (to be included as a RNF comment).
