Scanning Tunneling Spectra Python Analysis

Establishes a python class called spectra which takes a single .VERT file as an input

Automatically pulls parameters of particular importance including:
ZPiezoconst
LockinAmpl

Once called, spectra object contains has the following properties:
t: total time the spectra took
V: sample voltage (volts)
z: (Angstroms)
I: current (amps)
dIdV: differential conductance (amps)
V0, I0, z0 dIdV0: copies of these files which are maintained after methods are applied

Methods available:
average(hyst_cor = True): if there are multiple passes, averages the spectra back and forth. hyst_cor (default True) applies a correction accounting for differences upon sweeping
normalize(kappa): if using a z-ramp, this is useful. Multiplies the current and conductance by exp(-2*kappa*z) where kappa is a provided number (or array same length as z) to be determined by measurement
