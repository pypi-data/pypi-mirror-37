LinchPin documentation
=======================

Welcome to the LinchPin documentation!

LinchPin is a simple and flexible hybrid cloud orchestration tool. Its intended purpose is managing cloud resources across multiple infrastructures. These resources can be provisioned, decommissioned, and configured all using declarative data and a simple command-line interface.

Additionally, LinchPin provides a Python API for managing resources. The cloud management component is backed by `Ansible <https://ansible.com>`_. The front-end API manages the interface between the command line (or other interfaces) and calls to the Ansible API.

This documentation covers LinchPin version (|release|). For recent features, see the updated |link-pre|\ |version|\ |link-post|.

.. note:: Releases are formatted using `semantic versioning <https://semver.org>`_. If the release shown above is a pre-release version, the content listed may not be supported. Use `latest </en/latest>`_ for the most up-to-date documentation.
