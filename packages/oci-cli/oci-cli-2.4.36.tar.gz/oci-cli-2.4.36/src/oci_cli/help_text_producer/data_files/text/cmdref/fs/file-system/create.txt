create
******


Description
===========

Creates a new file system in the specified compartment and
availability domain. Instances can mount file systems in another
availability domain, but doing so might increase latency when compared
to mounting instances in the same availability domain.

After you create a file system, you can associate it with a mount
target. Instances can then mount the file system by connecting to the
mount target's IP address. You can associate a file system with more
than one mount target at a time.

For information about access control and compartments, see Overview of
the IAM Service.

For information about availability domains, see Regions and
Availability Domains. To get a list of availability domains, use the
*ListAvailabilityDomains* operation in the Identity and Access
Management Service API.

All Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources, including file systems, get
an Oracle-assigned, unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier
(OCID).  When you create a resource, you can find its OCID in the
response. You can also retrieve a resource's OCID by using a List API
operation on that resource type or by viewing the resource in the
Console.
