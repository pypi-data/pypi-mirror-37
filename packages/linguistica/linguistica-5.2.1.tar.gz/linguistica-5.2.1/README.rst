Linguistica 5 is a Python library for unsupervised learning
of linguistic structure.

Full documentation: http://linguistica-uchicago.github.io/lxa5/

Apart from being a Python library, Linguistica 5 provides two additional
interfaces: (i) graphical user interface; (ii) command line interface.

Work by Jackson Lee and John Goldsmith


Please note that this code (Linguistica 5) is not John Goldsmith's development code,
which can be found on
`his GitHub repository <https://github.com/JohnAGoldsmith/lxa5_0>`_.
The most recent release of John Goldsmith's code is Linguistica 4; see
`Linguistica at UChicago <http://linguistica.uchicago.edu/>`_.


Download and install
--------------------

Note: If you are a developer of the Linguistica project group, you should ignore
this section and set up your environment by following
`these notes <http://linguistica-uchicago.github.io/lxa5/dev.html#setting-up-the-development-environment>`_.

Linguistica 5 is available through ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install linguistica

Linguistica 5 works with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

To use the graphical user interface, only Python 3 is supported.
In addition, PyQt5 and SIP are required.
PyQt5 is readily available from ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install PyQt5

At the time of writing (April 2017), SIP is best downloaded and installed from
`its source <http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/sip4/installation.html>`_.
(SIP is available through ``pip``, but it does not include
the C/C++ code generator for PyQt5.)


Using Linguistica 5
-------------------

To use Linguistica 5 as a Python library, simply import ``linguistica``
in your Python programs:

.. code-block:: python

   import linguistica as lxa

Quick library demo `here <http://linguistica-uchicago.github.io/lxa5/demo.html>`_.

To launch the Linguistica 5 graphical user interface
(with SIP and PyQt5 installed):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ linguistica gui

To launch the Linguistica 5 command line interface:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ linguistica cli
