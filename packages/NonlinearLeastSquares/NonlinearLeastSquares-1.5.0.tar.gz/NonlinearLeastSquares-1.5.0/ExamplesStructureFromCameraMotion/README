    This directory contains two scripts that show how you can use the
    NonlinearLeastSquares class for solving the scene-structure-from-
    camera-motion problem.

    However, note that since the module dies not yet include sparse bundle
    adjustment code, you will only be able to solve very simple problems in
    which the scene structure consists of at most half-a-dozen points in
    world 3D.

    The two scripts are: 

        sfm_with_calibrated_cameras_translations_only.py

        sfm_with_calibrated_cameras_translations_and_rotations.py

    where the prefix "sfm" stands for "structure from motion".

    As the names of the scripts imply, we assume that the cameras are
    calibrated.  The ProjectiveCamera class makes it easy to specify
    calibrated cameras.  The constructor of the class first gives you a
    camera for which you can specify the internal and the external
    parameters through the constructor options. Subsequently, you can apply
    translational and rotational transformations to the camera to move it
    to different locations in world 3D.  Since the 3x4 camera matrices for
    all these positions of the camera are known, you end up with a set of
    fully calibrated cameras for experimenting with structure-from-motion
    simulations.
