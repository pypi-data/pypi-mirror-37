    In theory, event handlers should ignore ``next`` callable since it makes no
    sense. But there may be cases when middleware does not know whether to call
    the ``next`` or not. Empty callable can be provided as a workaround, and
    middleware can call ``next`` without thinking about it.

    Empty callable just immediately returns.
