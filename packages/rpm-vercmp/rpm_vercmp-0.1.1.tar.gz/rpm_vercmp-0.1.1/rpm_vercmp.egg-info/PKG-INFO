Description: Pure Python implementation of rpmvercmp.
        
        The RPM Package Manager (http://rpm.org) has a version comparision algorithm,
        implemented in its C library, which performs the comparison in a certain way.
        
        In certain circumstances, where the C library is not installable (for example,
        on non-rpm based systems), or does not support the desired version of the
        python interpreter, the pure-python implementation may be useful.
        
        Source Code
        ===========

        Installation
        ============
                $ pip install rpm_vercmp
        
        Usage
        =====
        
                import rpm_vercmp
                assert rpm_vercmp.vercmp("1.0", "1.0") == 0
                assert rpm_vercmp.vercmp("1.0", "1.1") == -1
        
        Testing
        =======
        The testsuite uses rpm's test file in m4 format.
