\label{sec:param}

In this python file, which is imported in all the PAGO functions, are
stored the parameters that may be modified by the user. \\

Among these parameters, the depths intervals used in the computation
of transport indices (\verb+lev1+, \verb+lev2+ and \verb+lev3+), the
reference salinity for the freshwater transport (\verb+S0+), the value
of $\rho_0C$ for the heat content and heat transport calculations
(\verb+rho0_c+), the ellipsoid used in the distance computation.\\

Parameters used in the \verb+pypago.figure_section_1l+ function are also defined in
this file: the size of the figure, the positionning of the panels and
the colormaps.\\
