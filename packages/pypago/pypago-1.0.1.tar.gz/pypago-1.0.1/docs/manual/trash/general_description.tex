\section{Introduction}

This document describes the Python version of the ``Physical Analysis
of Gridded Ocean'' (\pa{} hereafter) set of Matlab programs available at
\url{http://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/pago/}.\\

This set of programms permits to compare the temperature, salinity and
velocity issued from numerical models or gridded datasets along user-defined sections.\\

The main difference in the Python version is the Graphical User
Interface (GUI) that has been developped, in order to make it more
user-friendly. Also, some slight modifications about masking and area
generation have been added.\\

These features will be described thoroughly in the present document.

\section{Requierements}

PyPago needs the following Python librairies to be installed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \verb+numpy+: \url{http://www.numpy.org/}
\item \verb+matplotlib+: \url{http://matplotlib.org/}
\item \verb+basemap+: \url{http://matplotlib.org/basemap/}
\item \verb+netCDF4+: \url{http://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/}
\item \verb+wxPython+: \url{http://www.wxpython.org/}
\end{enumerate}

The first three packages are available with the Anaconda Scientific
Python distribution (\url{https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/}). The \verb+netCDF4+
librairy, which is recommended since it allows the opening of multiple
netcdf files, is also included in the Anaconda distribution but only for
Linux or Mac Os X machines. The \verb+wxPython+, which handles the GUI, has
to be installed manually. These packages can also be installed using Synaptic (Linux) or Mac
Port (Mac Os X)
