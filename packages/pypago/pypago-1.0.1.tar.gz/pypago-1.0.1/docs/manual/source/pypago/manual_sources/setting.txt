Setting of |pypago|
===================

.. _sec_param:

Prior to using the software, the user might need to change some of the
default settings of |pypago|. This is achieved by editing the
:py:mod:`pypago.__param__` module.

Among the parameters that the user is likely to change, there are depths
intervals used in the computation of transports, the reference salinity
used for the freshwater transport, the value of :math:`\rho_0C` used in the
heat content and heat transport calculations, but also the ellipsoid used in
the distance computation.

Furthermore, some of the figure settings, such as the default line
width, the use of LaTeX in :py:mod:`matplotlib`, the colormaps used in
the salinity, temperature and velocity figures.
