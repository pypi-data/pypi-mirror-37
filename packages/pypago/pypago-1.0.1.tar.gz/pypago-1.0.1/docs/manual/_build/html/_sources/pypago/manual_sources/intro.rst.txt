General description
*******************

This document describes the Python version of the "Physical Analysis
of Gridded Ocean" (|pypago| hereafter) set of |matlab| programs available at
http://www.whoi.edu/science/PO/pago/.
This set of programs aims at comparing the temperature, salinity and
velocity fields of gridded ocean models along pre-defined sections.

The main difference between the Python and |matlab| versions is the
Graphical User Interface (GUI) that has been developed, in order to make
it more user-friendly.
Also, some slight modifications about masking and area generation have been
added.
These features are described in the present document.
